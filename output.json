That ought to have led to a \u201ctrue\u201d rating.

The schoolboy\u2019s family have since filed for compensation to the tune of $15 million from the City of Irving and the district school board.Incidents like these, Sharnoubi asserts, are little more than America\u2019s attempt to fool themselves and others.\u201cWhat terror are they talking about and associating with Islam or even with extremist Muslims or people claiming to be Muslims?\u201dMeanwhile, murders committed by the West, she writes, such as \u201cthe killing of civilians, women and children by American planes in Afghanistan and Iraq\u201d are not considered terror.Sharnoubi then regurgitates conspiracy theories surrounding the 9/11 attacks, saying the U.S. administration\u2019s official version of events is simply not credible.How is it possible, she asks, that American-trained Islamist pilots penetrated U.S. airspace and \u2013 despite \u201call their intelligence, satellites and radars\u201d \u2013 managed to carry out attacks at multiple locations without American forces downing the planes?\u201cOr was the whole thing planned in order to justify the war on terror?\u201d she continues.\u201cDoes it make sense that most Islamic State members are foreigners [i.e., Western nationals], unless IS is another story that was prepared in advance [by the West] to justify the devastation, partitioning and occupation [of countries] that is taking place and will continue to take place in the Middle East?\u201dShe brings more \u201cproof\u201d of her claim in the example of a\u00a0video clip showing Egyptian Christians being butchered by IS fighters who are \u201ctall, had the same white [skin], and wore identical expensive foreign-made watches?\u201dIn Sharnoubi\u2019s view, Western \u201cintelligence elements are behind the attacks and the bombings, and later Muslim citizens are arrested and killed and simply accused of perpetrating [the attacks] in order to justify what is happening in the Arab countries in the name of the war on terror, and in order to justify the plan to persecute the Muslims in the U.S. and Europe and expel them?

Pollak9 Oct 20160First up was political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson, who commented on the press conference Trump held before the debate with four of Bill Clinton\u2019s female accusers, to highlight how Hillary Clinton attacked\u00a0them: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough argument. And you\u2019ve seen Breitbart and other outlets make this case for many, many years.\u201dNext, CNN\u2019s chief national correspondent, John King, reported that Republican leaders were opposed to the press conference: \u201cThey\u2019re aghast. They don\u2019t think it is \u00a0the right strategy. They think he is having a Breitbart TV reality show before the second presidential debate.\u201dAfter the debate, as CNN\u2019s senior reporters\u00a0expressed their horror that Trump had called for appointing a special prosecutor to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton, King said that Trump had been \u201clistening to his alt-right advisers. This was a Breitbart strategy. From the pre-debate, and through the debate.\u201d(CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, had just compared Trump to Hitler and Stalin in expressing her outrage that Hillary Clinton might be held to the same legal standard as every other American who is entrusted with classified information.)Finally, CNN anchor Jake Tapper weighted in: \u201cIm sure he will win every online poll. I know that the Breitbart crowd ate this up. My question is: did he win over any suburban households in Philadelphia?\u201dHis co-panelist, CNN contributor and conservative author Jeffrey Lord, said that he thought Trump had, in fact, won support among those voters with his performance.Joel B.

I\u2019m not sure any minds were changed at this debate tonight. I think so much has occurred over the last 48 hours and this last week\u00a0that people have\u00a0to digest all of this, including the debate tonight, to see where they stand.\u201d Co-panelist Mike Smerconish declared Trump the winner \u201con points\u201d: \u201cI think the night belongs to Donald Trump,\u201d he said. But Smerconish\u00a0added that Trump had fallen short, regardless: \u201cDid he grow the tent? I can\u2019t see that there was any outreach.\u201dTrump beat Clinton despite facing a three-on-one press from his opponent and from the moderators, who were at least as biased as they had been in any of the previous debates. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper fired repeated follow-ups at Trump while leaving Clinton largely alone. But he, at least, brought up tough questions for Clinton on occasion.\u00a0ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz actively debated Trump at times, and silenced the audience when it cheered for Trump \u2014 though not for Clinton.Still, Trump overcame that hostility and pressed Clinton effectively on the issues, as well as on her weakest points \u2014 the email scandal, Benghazi, and Obamacare. He was on better ground than Clinton when it came to citing facts, and he forced her into repeating the rather serious lie that the only emails she deleted from her private server were personal in nature. He also stood his ground on substantive policy questions while maintaining his cool \u2014 for the most part \u2014 when she tried\u00a0personal attacks.The media had largely\u00a0declared the presidential race for Hillary Clinton Saturday, after many Republicans criticized Trump over comments he made in 2005 about groping women. The comments were captured by a live mic and surfaced Friday. Chuck Todd, political director of NBC News, said \u201cthe presidential race is over,\u201d according to Republicans with whom he spoke. Despite Trump\u2019s debate win, the media will be\u00a0reluctant\u00a0to let go of that narrative, with many cheering for his demise.At the first debate, Trump refrained from placing any of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety in the front row, despite threatening to do so. This time, with the media and the Hillary Clinton campaign hitting Trump over his old remarks, Trump more than delivered on the threat, holding a press conference with four of Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers \u2014 who also accused Hillary Clinton of trying to silence and slander them \u2014 before the debate, and placing them in the front row.The Donald Trump that debated Hillary Clinton in St. Louis was better prepared, more passionate, and more focused on the issues than he was two weeks ago. He won, under incredible pressure.The voters will see it, even if the media will not.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Huntingdon, of \u201cClash of Civilizations\u201d fame\u00a0and a life-long Democrat and foreign policy hawk.Huntington noted in 2004 that the global elites \u201chave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations\u201d.CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT\u00a0FOR PEACEFP was bought by the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, a globalist think tank founded by internationalist Andrew Carnegie. To give further context to this, the current President is\u00a0William J. Burns \u2013 the former\u00a0United States Deputy Secretary of State (2011-14). In other words, he worked for Hillary Clinton.WASHINGTON POST\u00a0Carnegie sold FP to the Washington Post group in 2008.When the\u00a0Washington Post \u2013 which has been an integral media ally of the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2013 bought FP, it was losing around $1.3m a year. But it was considered so integral to helping push a neoconservative, hawkish foreign policy, that it was worth the loss.The chairman of the Washington Post group in 2008 was Donald E. Graham, who said of the acquisition: \u201cForeign Policy is a terrific magazine, and I\u2019m pleased it will become a part of our company\u2026 Foreign Policy furthers our commitment to great magazine journalism and gives us another opportunity to expand our journalism online\u201d.SLATE GROUPIn 2008, Foreign Policy was moved into the Slate group, the home of the left-wing Slate magazine.Slate\u2019s editor in chief is Jacob Weisberg, an NPR contributor, left-wing New Republic contributor, New York Times contributor, contributing editor to Vanity Fair, and columnist for the Financial Times.FP Group\u2019s Media Kit promotes Hillary Clinton as its foremost recent contributorGRAHAM HOLDINGS COMPANYWhen Amazon owner Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, he did not buy the loss-making Foreign Policy magazine with its declining readership. Alexa.com, which is a site ranking organisation run by Amazon itself, reveals Foreign Policy to be the\u00a09719th website in the world compared to its competitor the Economist, which is the\u00a01,935th website.Instead, the magazine stayed with the aforementioned Donald Graham, who changed the name of the Washington Post group to Graham Holdings Company to reflect the sale of the paper.The magazine now operates under the FP Group, headed up by David Rothkopf.Rothkopf, to square FP\u2019s historical circle, is a scholar of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. He was a managing director at Kissinger Associates,\u00a0former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\u2019s New York-based consulting firm which was founded alongside\u00a0Mack McLarty, President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff.But greater still, Rothkopf himself served as U.S. Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade under\u00a0the Clinton Administration in 1993, when Mr. Clinton was signing NAFTA\u00a0which Donald Trump has pledged to reform.DONALD E. GRAHAMGraham, the Chairman and CEO of the company that owns Foreign Policy magazine, is married to Amanda Bennett, a Bloomberg journalist who has just moved to Voice of America.In 2014, the pair founded a \u201cmultimillion dollar National Scholarship Fund\u201d for the children of illegal immigrants in the United States.The organisation has solicited large donations from many Hillary Clinton supporters such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Fernandez Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and a whopping $5m from Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg.\u2018BREAKING WITH TRADITION\u2019Foreign Policy magazine\u2019s claim to be \u201cbreaking with tradition\u201d in endorsing Hillary Clinton is anything but accurate.Perhaps it has never written an editorial, but its entire editorial line and history is, in and of itself, a tradition of endorsing globalist, neoconservative, pro open borders policies and candidates.The idea that this is somehow a big deal is a total farce.Follow Raheem Kassam on Twitter2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, carnegie endowment for peace, david e graham, foreign policy, Hillary Clinton, Slate, Washington PostComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

LOUIS, Missouri0ST. LOUIS, Missouri \u2014 Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, appeared with three alleged sexual assault victims of former President Bill Clinton in the hours before he debates Clinton\u2019s wife, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, here at Washington University. The women\u2014Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick\u2014have each leveled various charges against Bill Clinton. They also each have charged that Hillary Clinton was an \u201cenabler\u201d of Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior in exclusive interviews with Breitbart News\u2019 Aaron Klein published on Sunday.In addition, Kathy Shelton\u2014who was allegedly raped when she was 12 years old, while Hillary Clinton defended her accused rapist\u2014spoke as well.Before the event started, a leftist\u00a0reporter\u00a0yelled at Trump: \u201cMr. Trump, does your star power allow you to touch women without their consent?\u201dThen Trump, ignoring the reporter, opened the panel event and said: \u201cThank you very much for coming, and these four very courageous women have asked to be here and it was our honor to help them. I think we\u2019re each going to make just an individual short statement, and then we will have a little meeting and we will see you at the debate.\u201dWATCH THE VIDEO:Jones, who kicked it off, said, \u201cI\u2019m here to support Mr. Trump because he\u2019s going to make America great again, and I think everybody else should vote for him.\u201cI think they should all look at the fact that he is a good person, he\u2019s not what other people have been saying he\u2019s been, not Hillary\u2014so think about that,\u201d Jones said.Shelton then said, \u201cI\u2019m also here to support Trump.\u201d She stated that \u201cat 12 years old, Hillary put me through something that you would never put a 12-year-old through.\u201d\u201cShe says she\u2019s for women and children,\u201d Shelton added, noting that Hillary Clinton stands against women and children because she was caught \u201claughing on tape\u201d last year when asked about her case.Broaddrick went next. \u201cI\u2019m here to support Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI tweeted recently, and Mr. Trump retweeted it, that actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump may have said some bad words but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any comparison.\u201dWilley, who was the last to speak on the short panel, noted as well that \u201cI am here to support Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cThe reason for that is the first day that he announced for president he said, \u2018I love this country and I want America to be great again.\u2019 And I cried when he said that because I think this is the greatest country in the world,\u201d Willey said. \u201cI think that we can do anything. I think we can accomplish anything. I think that he can bring peace to this world. And I think Donald Trump can lead us to that point.\u201dWhen Trump wrapped the event, which was broadcast live on his Facebook page, the same reporter shouted more questions.\u201cMr. Trump, have you touched women without their consent?\u201d the reporter shouted multiple times.Jones, after the reporter wouldn\u2019t stop harassing Trump and the panel, fired back: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask Bill Clinton that? Why don\u2019t y\u2019all go ask Bill Clinton that? Go ahead\u2014ask Hillary as well.\u201dThe room erupted in applause for Jones.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, kathy shelton, Paula JonesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The overall trade deficit, including both goods and services, was lower at $500 billion. Trump has generally focused more on the deficit in goods, and the difficulty it represents for America\u2019s manufacturing sector.\nby Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUE\u201cWhen I\u00a0look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided\u00a0transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state \u2013 really, the number one terrorist state,\u201d Trump told the audience, responding to a question from the audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve made them a strong country from, really, a very weak\u00a0country just three years ago.\u201dTrump has made this claim regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), as the Iran nuclear deal is officially known, and received some criticism for it. Fact-checking websites such as Politifact have argued that Trump\u2019s claim is false because \u201cthe money is already Iran\u2019s to begin with,\u201d but not denied that this amount of money would return to the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei thanks to the deal.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0has argued that the $150 billion estimate is a fabrication by \u201ccongressional Republicans\u201d far from the real amount of money Iran would once again control.As\u00a0Algemeiner,\u00a0citing\u00a0Omri Ceren of the Israel Project, notes, the twelve-figure estimate of the money the deal would return to Iranian control came from President Barack Obama, not Republicans. President Obama\u00a0said in an interview\u00a0that Iran \u201chas $150 billion parked outside the country,\u201d arguing that not all of its funds under sanctions will be unfrozen immediately because \u201cunwinding the existing restraints\u2026 takes a certain amount of time.\u201dThis money does not include a separate\u00a0$1.7 billion\u00a0payment to the government of Iran, allegedly to atone for an arms sales agreement that never went through after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\u00a0The U.S. government\u00a0handed over that money\u00a0the same day that Iran released several American citizens imprisoned on dubious charges.Both\u00a0President Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Secretary of State John Kerry, who played a major role in brokering the Iran nuclear deal, have admitted that the Iranian regime will likely use the money to fund terrorism, particularly activity by the Shiite terrorist organization Hezbollah.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEBill Clinton was indeed impeached for lying under oath to a grand jury and obstructing justice, although he was not removed from office.After impeachment, Bill Clinton was held in contempt of court by federal Judge Susan Webber Wright, in what the New York Times described as a \u201cscathing\u201d ruling. Wright said Clinton testified falsely in his deposition about not having sex with Monica Lewinsky, and that his actions \u201csubverted the rule of law and violated Ms. Jones\u2019s right to information relevant to her case.\u201d\u201cThe court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation\u2019s President in contempt of court,\u201d Wright wrote. However, she added, \u201cthe record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiffs\u2019 questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process.\u201dClinton\u2019s law license in Arkansas was suspended for five years, and he paid a $25,000 fine. The Supreme Court also barred Clinton from practicing law before the nation\u2019s highest court.Trump made a reference to an $850,000 fine Bill Clinton paid to Paula Jones. This was, in fact, an out-of-court\u00a0settlement Clinton reached with Jones, not a fine leveled by the court.\u00a0The purpose of reaching an out-of-court settlement is to avoid an unpleasant trial that could very well end with even worse consequences, so Trump is basically correct that Clinton\u2019s conduct cost him $850,000, and he didn\u2019t want to pay it \u2013 it most certainly was not a charitable contribution! \u2013 but it technically wasn\u2019t a \u201cfine.\u201dby Joel B.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who allegedly faked Native American heritage to obtain a professorship at Harvard Law School.\u00a0And in August, he expressed \u201cregret\u201d for some of the things he had said that had offended people (including, presumably, the Khizr Khan episode, which Clinton mentioned).

Some examples:\u201cIf you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don\u2019t have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.\u201d (June 2013)\u201cSo we\u2019re in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you\u2019re going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what\u2019s succeeding, fix what isn\u2019t, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.\u201d (January 2015)What Clinton says in public is often very different than what she tells her private speaking audiences. For example, she recently said she thought single-payer would \u201cnever, ever happen,\u201d but she was making a prediction and saying that ObamaCare repairs couldn\u2019t wait for a single-payer system to be created, not expressing her own policy preference: \u201cI want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act. I don\u2019t want it repealed, I don\u2019t want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don\u2019t want us to end up in gridlock. People can\u2019t wait! People who have health emergencies can\u2019t wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.\u201dDuring Clinton\u2019s primary run against Bernie Sanders, the New York Times found her moving to the left on health care and saying she was \u201cin favor of what\u2019s called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age.\u201d Sanders was explicitly in favor of single-payer health care\u2026 and described it as \u201cMedicare for all.\u201dby Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSE.\u00a0According to FBI Director James Comey, \u201cthe FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not among the group of 30,000 e-mails returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.\u201d\u00a0Federal investigators concluded\u00a0that Clinton\u2019s lawyers deleted nearly half of the 60,000 emails on her server.\u00a0by Joel B.

We are by no means carrying anywhere near the load Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be, from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\u201dFact-Check: FALSE (According to Clinton herself)\u00a0The Wikileaks dump revealed that Clinton herself said refugees \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d be vetted, as Breitbart News reported:\u00a0Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign to reconcile the differences between Secretary Clinton\u2019s 2013 private remarks, where she said Syrian refugees \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d be vetted, to her 2015 and 2016 campaign claims that \u201cvigilant\u201d screening and \u201cvetting\u201d of \u201crefugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,\u201d will be sufficient to safeguard American citizens from \u201cjihadists coming in along with legitimate refugees,\u201d but there has not yet been a response.We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Secretary Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan, which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees; she admits we cannot.The entire quote from Clinton\u2019s speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago\u2019s Vanguard Luncheon on October 28, 2013, included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches reads as follows:\u201cSo I think you\u2019re right to have gone to the places that you visited because there\u2019s a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it\u2019s on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can\u2019t possibly vet all those refugees so they don\u2019t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cTurkey for the same reason.\u201d\u00a0In September, a top Obama immigration official also admitted to Congress that some refugees launch terrorist plots after they\u2019ve been \u201cvetted\u201d and invited into the United States.\u00a0by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUEThis is an extremely difficult statement to fact-check, because a great deal depends on what is meant by \u201creforming the tax code.\u201d A thorough rundown of Clinton\u2019s voting records on tax issues prepared by Forbes in April 2015 reveals little in Senator Clinton\u2019s record that could be fairly described as a significant reform.In summary, Clinton voted against the Bush tax cuts, but voted for a few amendments to the bill that did not pass; she eventually voted yes to extend those tax cuts, while complaining that she thought they benefited the wealthy too much. She voted in favor of a minor alteration to the Alternative Minimum Tax, to raise the exemption, while voting against a bill that would have repealed it, something that would have been a major tax reform. At the end of her term, she tried to raise the top marginal tax rate back to its pre-Bush level, which is hardly a \u201creform\u201d of the system.by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhile\u00a0one video\u00a0published by the Al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab in Somalia uses video of Trump calling for a\u00a0\u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d Trump is largely absent from Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Hamas, and Hezbollah propaganda \u2013 the major jihadist groups who expend resources on producing propaganda to recruit fighters.Much of the propaganda released by one of the most active jihadist groups in the world, the Islamic State, focuses largely on the Quranic theme of\u00a0jihad (\u201choly war\u201d) and cites both the Quran and the Islamic documents known as\u00a0hadiths. At one time,\u00a0half\u00a0of the propaganda the group published sold potential recruits on constructing a jihadist utopia in Syria and Iraq. Much of the\u00a0media\u00a0that does not touch on the benefits of living in a society cleansed of infidels instead depicts\u00a0graphic executions, including some\u00a0performed by children,\u00a0intended to intimidate the Western world.One exception is a video in which an image of Bill Clinton captioned \u201cfornicator\u201d is used as a rallying cry to destroy America, \u201ca secular state built on man-made laws whose soldiers fight for the interests of legislators, liars, fornicators, corporations, and for the freedom of Sodomites.\u201dThe rise\u00a0of\u00a0groups like the Islamic State \u2013 formerly Al Qaeda in Iraq \u2013 has been fueled significantly\u00a0by the growing chaos in the Middle East that followed the implementation of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy since 2008. The\u00a0Obama White House\u2019s approach\u00a0to the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, the fall of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, the Houthi uprising in Yemen, and the teenaged war in Afghanistan have all left significant power vacuums from which jihadist groups have benefitted greatly \u2013 not just the Islamic State, but formerly moribund jihadist groups like\u00a0Al Qaeda. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was\u00a0critical\u00a0in implementing these policies.by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: HALF FALSEIt is true that the Birther movement started among Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters. And, as Breitbart News reported, Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, admitted that at least one member of the campaign had helped propagate the rumor (though she said that person was fired.) It is also likely true that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal shopped the story to reporters. And it is unknown how much involvement Hillary Clinton herself had with the movement.However, it is a stretch to say, as Trump did, that Hillary Clinton herself personally started the Breitbart movement, and it is incorrect to claim that her campaign manager corroborated that particular accusation.(The real truth about the Birther rumor, which the mainstream media choose to ignore, may be that Barack Obama started it himself by allowing his literary agent to claim, for nearly two decades, that he was born in Kenya.)by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEThe\u00a0New York Times\u00a0obtained Trump\u2019s tax returns which revealed that the Republican nominee\u00a0avoided paying federal income taxes by reporting losses on his 1995 tax return.Clinton criticized Trump\u00a0as the hypocritical embodiment of\u00a0\u201cthe same rigged system he claims he will change.\u201dHowever, Clinton herself has taken advantage of the same tax loopholes she\u2019s hammered Trump over.\u00a0According to Clinton\u2019s\u00a02015 tax returns,\u00a0she reported capital gains losses to lessen her tax burden through a \u201ccarryover.\u201dOn page 17, \u201cCapital Gains and Losses\u201d for \u201cWilliam J Clinton\u00a0&\u00a0Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Clintons reported a \u201clong-term capital loss carryover\u201d of $699,540. In other words,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0reported a \u201cnet long-term capital gain or (loss)\u201d of negative \u201c$699,540.\u201dDuring Sunday\u2019s debate clinton also falsely stated that Trump is \u201csomebody who maybe hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in 20 years.\u201d\u00a0That statement is also false.\u00a0The\u00a0Times\u00a0admits that Trump\u2019s\u00a0tax statements reveal that he may have\u00a0avoided paying income taxes for \u201cup to 18 years.\u201cby Frances Martel9 Oct 2016\u201cThey had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,\u201d Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked.\u00a0\u201cYou were there as Secretary of State with the so-called \u2018line in the sand.'\u201d\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, I was gone,\u201d Clinton replied.Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEPresident Obama delivered his famous \u201cred line\u201d speech \u2013 in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a \u201cred line\u201d that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences \u2013\u00a0in August 2012.\u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,\u201d President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State\u00a0from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013,\u00a0according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad\u00a0used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation.\u00a0Assad was most recently accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in Aleppo in\u00a0September 2016. He remains dictator of Syria after \u201cwinning\u201d an election in 2014.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEClinton has frequently made this claim on the campaign trail, so media organizations have already had an opportunity to vet it. In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was \u201chidden\u201d and \u201cdebatable.\u201d\u201cBy all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children\u2019s health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,\u201d said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts \u2013 which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn\u2019t be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy\u2019s office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a legislator, she didn\u2019t write the law, and she wasn\u2019t the president, so she didn\u2019t make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\u201dThat encomium hardly supports Clinton\u2019s claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband\u2019s White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe \u2013 fact-checking Clinton\u2019s claims during her primary run against Barack Obama \u2013 found that Clinton \u201chad little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.\u201dOrrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, \u201cI do like her. We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No \u2013 Teddy does, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201d (\u201cTeddy\u201d is a reference to Senator Ted Kennedy.)by Joel B.

If he had said America was currently experiencing one of its slowest growth periods since 1929, he would have been entirely correct, but there have been a few slower periods \u2013 and, of course, a few outright recessions, or negative growth \u2013 since then.It would be playing word games to argue that the recessions shouldn\u2019t be counted, because they weren\u2019t economic growth. Even so, it wouldn\u2019t be correct to say the current growth rate is the absolute worst since 1929, although it is among the worst.It has been argued that the post-2009 recovery was the weakest of the post-war era, and that Obama\u2019s is the only presidency since the Great Depression that never reached 3% GDP growth, but that\u2019s not what Trump said.by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEDuring a\u00a0March 13,\u00a0CNN Town Hall\u00a0in Columbus, Ohio,\u00a0Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201dClinton\u00a0continued to explain\u00a0that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don\u2019t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.\u201dOhio, a key battleground state,\u00a0was the\u00a0ninth largest coal producing state\u00a0in 2013.\u00a0by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEResponding to an audience question asking what he would do to diminish \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d Trump noted that the United States has been targeted on multiple occasions in the past year by \u201cradical Islamic terrorists. \u201cAnd she,\u201d referring to Clinton, \u201cwon\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t use the term, \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,'\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, to solve the problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.

Trump\u2019s statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.As for Trump\u2019s assessment of the U.S. as having \u201cjust about the highest\u201d taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying \u201cjust about.\u201d More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he\u2019s talking about. There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates \u2013 America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world \u2013 currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico\u2019s unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.America\u2019s top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.Given the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America\u2019s were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that.by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUE.According to\u00a0the\u00a0the Urban Institute, which examined the\u00a0average Obamacare premium increases from 2015 to 2016, American consumers can expect\u00a0to see major spikes in their healthcare costs.Those people in Oklahoma, who bought their own low-cost exchange insurance plan, have seen their premiums rise\u00a041.8 percent\u00a0from 2015 to 2016.

McCabe9 Oct 2016Washington0Authors Glenn Greenwald and Lee Fang reveal an\u00a0excerpt from a January 2015 strategy memo, which says that Haberman (now writing for the New York Times) has a sterling record of \u201cteeing up stories\u201d for the Clinton campaign:We have has [sic] a very good relationship with Maggie Haberman of Politico over the last year. We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed. While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengageing [sic] the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.The Intercept reports that the memo discussed how to generate positive press for Clinton\u2019s decision making. The site found two articles by Haberman that did the job: here and here.In the first article, Haberman describes touts Clinton\u2019s decision to hire a research team to unearth\u00a0negative items about her \u2014 a process called \u201cself-vetting.\u201d Her insider account bore the title\u00a0\u201cHillary Clinton Begins Process of Vetting \u2014 Herself\u201d:The scope of the firm\u2019s work is unclear. But self-research is considered critical in campaigns. And in the six years since Mrs. Clinton was last a candidate, she has created a paper trail of paid speeches, charitable donations and diplomatic decisions as secretary of state.For months, Democrats not aligned with Mrs. Clinton had privately wondered whether she had started the process of assessing the scope of existing documents, information and other potential material her rivals could use against her. Some expressed concern that she was beginning this self-scrubbing process relatively late, and might not leave herself enough time to learn about her own potential vulnerabilities to be able to respond effectively.In the second article, \u201cHillary Clinton Aides Are in Talks to Fill Top Campaign Roles,\u201d Haberman shows the care and concern Clinton had building her team:The prospects are mostly people who have worked with Mrs. Clinton before, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who asked for anonymity to speak freely about personnel discussions.The conversations reflect a fast-moving effort by Mrs. Clinton to build a campaign as a number of Democratic Party operatives are vying for position. While the budding campaign had been criticized as too white and too male in its early stages, this group of operatives is diverse and would give Mrs. Clinton a number of women and people of color in top jobs.Greenwald and\u00a0Fang wrote that they gave both the Clinton campaign and Haberman 24 hours to contest the veracity of the documents.

Her Attacks on Hillary Clinton Are Not,\u201d says that although there may be truth to Broaddrick\u2019s claims regarding Bill Clinton, \u201cfar less credible, however, is Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her into silence.\u201dGoldberg argues that Broaddrick wrongly interpreted an interaction with Hillary at a fundraiser for Bill\u2019s gubernatorial campaign \u2014 seeing a threat where, in Goldberg\u2019s eyes, there was only typical gladhanding.Broaddrick has given her recollection of this event to Aaron Klein, the Breitbart News editor and reporter who conducted a video interview with her at Washington, DC\u2019s historic Watergate hotel.In an earlier radio interview, Broaddrick said that Clinton delivered\u00a0her line about \u201ceverything you do\u201d for Bill twice and asked if she understood what she was being told:Broaddrick stated that Hillary approached her \u201cand said \u2018It\u2019s so nice to meet you\u2019 and all of the niceties she was trying to say at the time.\u201d\u201cAnd said, \u2018I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him.\u2019 And I just stood there, Aaron. I was sort of you might say shell-shocked.\u201d\u201cAnd she said, \u2018Do you understand. Everything you do.\u2019\u2019\u2019\u201cShe tried to take a hold of my hand and I left. I told the girls I can\u2019t take this. I\u2019m leaving. So I immediately left.\u201dBroaddrick said that \u201cwhat really went through my mind at that time is \u2018She knows. She knew. She\u2019s covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.\u2019\u201dThese details are consistent with a 2000 open letter that Broaddrick wrote during Clinton\u2019s campaign to become U.S. Senator for the state of New York.Goldberg dismisses Broaddrick\u2019s version of events, saying, \u201cBroaddrick interpreted this as a threat, but it sounds like the kind of thing a candidate\u2019s wife at a political event would say to all his supporters. Even in her rendering of Hillary\u2019s words, there is nothing outwardly sinister in them.\u201dGoldberg then declares the question of Hillary\u2019s intimidation asked and answered.\u00a0\u201cWhen you examine every accusation of Hillary as an \u2018attacker\u2019 of women, it ends up looking equally flimsy,\u201d she writes. Her evidence? The aforementioned anecdote from Broaddrick and a private note where Clinton called Monica Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic loony tune.\u201dUnmentioned by Goldberg:\u2022Kathleen Willey\u2019s allegation that she was harassed and intimidated before testifying during Paula Jones\u2019 sexual assault lawsuit against Bill.\n\u2022A San Francisco talk show host\u2019s claim that notorious private detective Jack Palladino copped to involvement in this alleged intimidation campaign (the Washington Post first reported that the Clintons hired Palladino to handle \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d in 1992).\n\u2022Vanity Fair reporting that Clinton said of Gennifer Flowers: \u201cI would crucify her\u201d in court \u2014 though she was telling the truth and Bill did admit, years later, to an affair with Flowers.Goldberg then concludes with\u00a0a wish for Hillary to perform well in Sunday night\u2019s presidential debate. \u201cBill Clinton\u2019s history with women is hard to defend,\u201d she\u00a0writes. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s history is not.

(AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton took nearly every precaution to ensure voters would never know what she told investment bankers, lobbyists and corporate executives in dozens of closed-door paid speeches before running for president.Turns out, the Democratic presidential nominee had good reason to do so.The private comments strike a tone starkly at odds with the fiery message she\u2019s pushed throughout her campaign, particularly during the hard-fought Democratic primary. Some of her remarks give fresh fuel to liberals\u2019 worst fears about Clinton, namely that she is a political moderate, happy to cut backroom deals with corporate interests and curry favor with Wall Street for campaign dollars.The WikiLeaks organization on Friday posted what it said were thousands of emails obtained in a hack of the Clinton campaign chairman\u2019s personal email account. Among the documents posted online was an internal review of the speeches conducted by campaign aides to survey the political damage her remarks could cause if they ever became public.In what aides calculated were the most damaging passages, she reflects on the necessity of \u201cunsavory\u201d political dealing, telling real estate investors that \u201cyou need both a public and private position.\u201d To investment bankers from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, Clinton admits that she\u2019s \u201ckind of far removed\u201d from the middle-class upbringing that she frequently touts on the campaign trail. She tells Xerox CEO Ursula Burns that both political parties should be \u201csensible, moderate, pragmatic.\u201dAnd in speeches to some of the country\u2019s biggest banks, she highlighted her long ties to Wall Street, bantering with top executives and saying that she views the financial industry as a partner in government regulation.\u201cPart of the problem with the political situation, too, is that there is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives,\u201d she said, according to an excerpt from an October 2013 discussion with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.Clinton appears to question the importance of the divestment of assets that financial executives often undertake to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest when they enter government service.\u201cYou know, the divestment of assets, the stripping of all kinds of positions, the sale of stocks. It just becomes very onerous and unnecessary,\u201d she said.Clinton\u2019s campaign has refused to confirm \u2014 or deny \u2014 the authenticity of the thousands of emails, suggesting they were part of a Russian effort to influence the outcome of the presidential race. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,\u201d campaign chairman John Podesta tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.\u201dIn an effort to keep those speeches private, strongly worded contracts prohibited unauthorized recordings, reporters were banned and, in some cases, blog posts about her remarks pulled off websites. Throughout her campaign, she has staunchly refused to release transcripts, resisting pressure from primary rival Bernie Sanders and the media to do so.The WikiLeaks disclosures should be the kind of \u201cOctober surprise\u201d that would thrill Clinton\u2019s opponents, who\u2019ve spent years attacking her as untrustworthy and willing to say anything for personal gain.Yet Republicans have found themselves largely unable to capitalize on the moment, consumed instead by the latest scandal of their nominee, a video showing Trump admitting to making predatory and lewd advances on women.This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has saved Clinton from damaging political fallout. The memory of Clinton staggering and stumbling after leaving a 9/11 memorial event last month was largely erased by Trump\u2019s destructive performance in the first presidential debate.But Clinton\u2019s private comments, now public, aren\u2019t going away. If she wins the White House, they\u2019ll trail her into the Oval Office, planting seeds of distrust among some of her liberal allies.A January 2016 email from the Clinton campaign\u2019s research director to top communications staffers includes excerpts from 15 of the more than 100 speeches she gave after leaving the State Department, appearances that netted her $21.7 million.One passage puts Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has struggled with repeatedly during the 2016 election. During the first general election debate, Clinton said she supports \u201csmart and fair trade.\u201dBut nearly three years earlier, in a talk to a Brazilian bank, she said her \u201cdream\u201d is \u201ca hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders\u201d and asked her audience to think of what doubling American trade with Latin America \u201cwould mean for everybody in this room.\u201dIn another speech that year, Clinton conceded that presidential candidates need the financial backing of Wall Street to mount a competitive national campaign. That\u2019s a position that plays right into political attacks leveled by both Sanders and Trump, who\u2019ve accused Clinton of being bought and paid for by Wall Street.\u201cNew York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle,\u201d she said at the October 2013 investor conference, sponsored by Goldman Sachs. \u201cThere are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy.\u201dThree years after her speech, her campaign and pro-Clinton super PACs have raised nearly $59 million from financial investors, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics.___Follow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Associated Press, Bernie Sanders, John Podesta, Lisa Lerer, Open Borders, wall street, WikiLeaksComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

McCabe9 Oct 2016Washington, D.C.0Raddatz, Breitbart News has learned, refused to publish a story on the alleged improper collusion and coordination between then Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) and the national headquarters of the\u00a0Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, also known as ACORN\u2014despite having enough evidence to do so.Raddatz, along with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, will co-moderate this upcoming Sunday evening\u2019s presidential debate between GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton.After she and her producer received a tip about ACORN corruption\u2014and Obama\u2019s connection to it\u2014and evidence backing up the eventual whistleblower\u2019s claims, they showed initial interest in pursuing the story. Anita Moncrief, the eventual ACORN whistleblower told Breitbart News exclusively that she met with Raddatz\u2019s producer Avni Patel in 2008.Both Patel and Raddatz were given documents that they covered up and refused to report on until after the election. Raddatz, who was then the White House correspondent for ABC News, and her producer Patel were also provided with personal accounts of the collusion between ACORN and the Obama campaign in October 2008, Moncrief told Breitbart News.Moncrief, who worked in ACORN\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters, would later expose the organization when she turned into a full-blown whistleblower after the election. But if Raddatz ran the story, the election may have turned out differently, especially had the public known the depths to which this scandal went.Moncrief told Breitbart News that she met with Raddatz\u2019s producer Patel in Washington after initially having made contact with Raddatz herself through a representative. The meeting lasted almost an hour in a coffee shop in Washington, D.C.After meeting with Patel, Moncrief received an email from the producer:Anita,\nIt was good talking to you today. I look forward to learning more, and\u00a0taking a look at those documents you mentioned. It sounds like the\u00a0easiest way to get those from you would be to directly download the\u00a0files from your web-transfer site. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can try\u00a0to\u00a0send them to my gmail account.Patel gave Moncrief every indication that ABC News was going to broadcast the report, she said.\u201cThey were very excited. They said they were willing to run the story,\u201d she said.Using the user name and password given to her by Patel, Moncrief sent documents on Oct. 14, 2008 to Patel using the company\u2019s file transfer protocol line, ftp1.abc.com.\u00a0There was another transfer of another dozen documents by email to Patel on Oct. 26, 2008.Moncrief told Breitbart News that ABC News received and acknowledged receipt of the documents that spelled out specific instances of collusion between the Obama campaign and named individuals at ACORN and Project Vote.\u00a0Among the documents were internal correspondences with Moncrief\u2019s name, which she said she included to prove that she was who she said she was.Moncrief told Breitbart News the Obama campaign passed to ACORN and by extension to its sister entity Project Vote the campaign\u2019s full donor list, which included all donors and fuller descriptions. This list was different from the limited list of contributors the campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission, which for example did not include small-dollar donors.\u00a0Because of their non-profit status, ACORN and Project Vote were prohibited from coordinating with a candidate\u2019s committee.ACORN and Project Vote also received the full donor lists from the 2004 presidential campaign of then Sen. John F. Kerry (D-MA), she said.Soon after Moncrief left ACORN, she contacted the New York Times and its reporter Stephanie Strom about the cooperation she witnessed. Strom and Moncrief worked together from July 2008 to October 2008.But, by September, Moncrief said she was frustrated with Strom\u2019s articles that were based on her information about ACORN and Project Vote, but failed to describe the cooperation.\u00a0Moncrief said Strom told her that her editors were watering down the stories after they were submitted.Attorney and columnist Michael Gaynor\u00a0told Breitbart News that over the summer of 2008, he became an adviser to Moncrief and her effort to expose ACORN-Obama corruption.In September 2008, Moncrief told him that she was beginning to think that the Times was just stringing her along, he said. \u201c\u2018I need a Plan B\u2019 she told me.\u201dGaynor calls himself a conservative Catholic and he said he immediately suggested EWTV, radio host Laura Ingraham and Fox News.The problem was that Moncrief was a left-wing activist and she wanted to go through a left-leaning media outlet, so he suggested ABC News and Martha Raddatz, he said.Gaynor said he met Raddatz through email because he she sent him proof that he had repeated a false claim about her suppressing the number of soldiers in Iraq supporting Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) for president.With that awkwardness between them, Gaynor said he reached out to Raddatz and explained to her the whole story of collusion between ACORN and Project Vote and the Obama campaign. After the initial conversation, Raddatz told Gaynor that she was interested.\u00a0Moncrief said she then emailed Raddatz and attached her resume, so that Raddatz would appreciate her background. Raddatz emailed back and told her that Patel would would follow up.Raddatz has a troubled history of undisclosed associations with Democrats that arguably affect her ability to be impartial.She\u00a0was the moderator for the 2012 vice presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and now House Speaker\u2014then GOP vice presidential nominee\u2014Paul Ryan. But Raddatz did not disclose to viewers that Biden\u2019s running mate, President Barack Obama, attended her 1991 wedding\u2014when she married now former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Julius Genachowski.The position of FCC chairman is a presidentially-appointed slot, which means Obama,\u00a0after attending her wedding to Genachowski,\u00a0appointed her by-then ex-husband to one of the most senior positions in the federal government. Raddatz and Genachowski divorced in 1997.\u00a0Genachowski, a long-time friend of the president\u2019s, also attended Obama\u2019s 1992 wedding,\u00a0when he married First Lady Michelle Obama.At a public event in 2013, after Obama and Biden won reelection, Breitbart News confronted Raddatz about her failure to disclose the significant conflict of interest to the general public before moderating that debate.At the National Press Club event, Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle asked Raddatz:\u201cDo you think\u2014there was obviously a little bit of a kerfuffle ahead of the vice presidential debate about the fact that the president attended your wedding to the FCC chairman. Do you think that that was handled right and given a second chance would you have done it a little differently?\u201dRaddatz responded:\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. I mean, I didn\u2019t have to handle that. It was\u2014and I\u2019m really not going to comment about that. That was something that happened two days before the debate. It had been in The New York Times quite a while before that, I believe. I just got to put this out of my head. That had nothing to do with what I did at the debate. Nothing.\u201dThis revelation about ABC News covering up the ACORN story before the 2008 election is also not the first time that network\u2014which is influenced heavily by former Bill Clinton White House staffer and ABC This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2014covered up a damning story about a Democrat right before an election.In fact, right before the 2012 election, ABC News among other outlets had been provided with intricate details about the scandal that has since, years later, led to the indictment of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ). They had a chance to break part of the scandal, and chose to not print allegations from prostitutes in the Dominican Republic that Menendez had underpaid them for sex.They also had evidence of other parts of the Menendez scandal, particularly connections to Democratic Party mega-donor Dr. Salomon Melgen\u2014who\u2019s also been indicted on the corruption charges\u2014that the network decided against running.When Raddatz had Menendez on her program after the election with the scandal dominating national news,\u00a0she conveniently forgot to ask him about it, as Breitbart News reported at the time.Shortly thereafter, ABC News attempted to undermine the accounts of several of the prostitutes\u2014but after Menendez was indicted, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed the prostitution allegations against Menendez were in fact supported by \u201ccorroborating evidence.\u201dEven BuzzFeed News admitted\u00a0Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle\u2014who originally reported the prostitution story while at The Daily Caller\u2014was correct on the story.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Acorn, barack obama, Bob Menendez, debate, Donald Trump, FCC, martha raddatzComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak9 Oct 20160The Democratic presidential nominee is exploiting\u00a0a video from 2005 that surfaced Friday, showing her Republican rival, Donald Trump, joking about groping women.Trump, while apologizing, has pointed to Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior towards women in the Oval Office and throughout his career \u2014 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in enabling it.Though Trump is not running against Bill, his defenders have focused on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s treatment of\u00a0the many women who accused her husband of impropriety and even assault \u2014 including Monica Lewinsky, Juanita Broaddrick, and others.The\u00a0Washington Post recently recalled the pattern of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defenses of her husband against what she called \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d:\u2026 Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers \u201csome failed cabaret singer who doesn\u2019t even have much of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to fall back on.\u201d She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, \u201cI mean, I would crucify her.\u201dThe\u00a0Post\u00a0noted: \u201cSix years later, Bill Clinton acknowledged a sexual encounter with Flowers.\u201dIt added that when the Lewinsky scandal emerged, in which Clinton had oral sex with the then-White House intern in the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton refused to credit the story of his accuser, choosing to believe her husband\u2019s lies instead. She reportedly called Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic loony toon.\u201dFormer Bill Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos, now an anchor for ABC News, wrote in his memoir All Too Human: A Political Education\u00a0that Hillary Clinton had to \u201csavage her enemies\u201d during the Lewinsky affair, repeating a pattern from previous scandals involving her husband\u2019s behavior towards women.In 1991, for example, when a woman named Connie Hamzy emerged to accuse Bill Clinton of having an affair with her, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cWe have to destroy her story,\u201d according to Stephanopoulos. He then set about arranging affidavits from people who could back up Bill Clinton\u2019s story: \u201cWe\u2019d survived our first bimbo eruption,\u201d Stephanopoulos recalled.Later, Stephanopoulos wrote, he wondered whether he had been \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior \u201cbecause my defense of Clinton against past bimbo eruptions had been predicated on my belief that he wouldn\u2019t create new ones.\u201dThe same might be said of Hillary Clinton.Joel B.

Some 47,000 Americans died from overdoses, mostly from heroin and other opiates, in just a single year, 2014.\u201cThe open border policies of Hillary Clinton, including catch and release, another terrible practice, have allowed a massive influx of drugs into New Hampshire, and frankly, to states all over our country. Almost every state. And it\u2019s really fueled the tremendous drug and heroin crisis that we have,\u201d Trump said.We\u2019re going to close up those borders, folks. Believe me. And I promise that to you in New Hampshire, more than anything else\u2014I said, I talk about it no matter where I go and I mention this state, because it was really the first glimpse I got at how serious a problem we have. They\u2019re poisoning our youth. They\u2019re poisoning more than our youth\u2014they\u2019re poisoning everybody. But they\u2019re poisoning our youth. It\u2019s tough enough out there. Our youth doesn\u2019t have a chance with what\u2019s happening, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore.\u201cWe\u2019re going to help the people that are so badly addicted,\u201d he added to applause. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help them\u2026 I\u2019m going to stop the drugs from coming in.\u201dNearly all of the heroin consumed in the U.S. comes from Mexico and is brought across the border by Mexican traffickers, the Washington Post reported before Trump\u2019s presidential run.While answering a question during the town hall, Trump repeated that he would stop the flow of deadly drugs pouring into the country. He said he had asked border patrol and ICE agents, \u201cHow important is the wall?\u201d\u201cThey said, \u2018Mr. Trump, it is absolutely necessary for us to do our proper job,'\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhich gave me a little additional security as far as the wall is concerned.\u201d\u201cWe need the wall. We have to stop the drugs\u2014heroin\u2014but many drugs. We have to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Believe me, it is poisoning our country. It\u2019s poisoning our youth. And we\u2019re going to stop it, and stop it fast, long before the wall gets up,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start that wall fast. I get \u2019em built fast. But I\u2019ll tell you, long before, we\u2019re going to stop that poison from flowing into our country.\u201d The audience applauded.While media outlets shut down their comments section so readers can\u2019t talk back, they can still receive massive blowback on Twitter.

Williams, Ph.D.7 Oct 20160In his article titled \u201cPope Francis\u2019 LGBT failure,\u201d Salon writer Nico Lang compares the Pope\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d against the gender ideology to those of \u201cthe right-wing extremists who have sought to prevent trans people from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity.\u201dThe Cool Pope is \u201cnot so cool after all,\u201d Lang quipped, just before comparing the Catholic Church to the Republican Party\u2014apparently the meanest slur he could come up with.The gender ideology claims that governments should require individuals to accept the \u201cgender identity\u201d of men or women who seek to live as members of the opposite sex. For example, new federal rules now urge punishment for K-12 students who refuse to use the female pronoun \u2013\u2018her\u201d \u2014 when referring a male classmate who dresses like a girl, or who do not want to share a bathroom with members of the opposite sex.Lang notes that this past weekend, Francis referred to teaching gender theory in schools as \u201cideological colonization.\u201dDuring his short\u00a0trip to the Caucasus, Pope Francis also called gender theory a \u201cgreat enemy\u201d of marriage, adding that the ideology of gender is part of a global war of ideas out to destroy traditional marriage.In an extended, off-the-cuff speech in Georgia, Francis said that today we are witnessing a \u201cglobal war to destroy marriage\u201d in which\u00a0gender theory\u00a0places a key role, fighting \u201cnot with weapons, but with ideas.\u201dBut although the Pope\u2019s stern opposition to gender theory may strike Nico Lang as a novelty, in point of fact, it is nothing new.For years the Pope has been an outspoken critic of LGBT agitators\u2019 efforts to impose same-sex marriage on society along with theories of gender fluidity that divorce gender from biological sexual differences.In March, Francis published an extensive\u00a0teaching\u00a0letter\u00a0on marriage and the family called\u00a0The Joy of Love\u00a0(Amoris Laetitia), in which he underscored the unique roles of motherhood and fatherhood, and called same-sex marriage legislation the \u201clegal deconstruction of the family.\u201dIn that same text, Francis slammed gender theory for its denial of \u201cthe difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman,\u201d and for its dream of \u201ca society without sexual differences.\u201d\u201cAn appreciation of our body as male or female,\u201d he said, is \u201cnecessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves.\u201d Efforts to erase sexual differences based in biology are a symptom of a sick society that \u201cno longer knows how to deal with it,\u201d he wrote.In the past, Francis has used even stronger language to denounce gender theory. In early 2014, the Pope called modern gender ideology \u201cdemonic,\u201d and compared the teaching of gender theory to children with the educational policies of\u00a0Hitler.In his Salon article, Lang declares that the pope\u2019s message on transgender \u201cboils down the old canard that the Catholic Church has been using against gays and lesbians for decades: \u2018Love the sinner, hate the sin.\u2019\u201dThe Pope\u2019s ideas are \u201cbiblically inaccurate\u201d and outdated, Lang insists.If loving sinners and hating sin is a \u201ccanard,\u201d at least the Pope has Jesus on his side\u2014even if Salon is no longer a fan.Follow Thomas D.

Still, hiring at that level is enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. Economists have expected the pace to slow as the supply of unemployed workers declines.The hiring figures could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise the short-term interest rate it controls by December. After seven years of pinning that rate at a record low near zero to try to spur more borrowing and spending, the Fed raised its rate in December. It has not acted since.But the Fed signaled after its policy meeting last month that it would likely act in the coming months. The Fed will meet in November, just before the election, but analysts expect it to hold off until the campaign ends.Recent data suggest that the economy is picking up after a weak start to the year, though growth is unlikely to accelerate very much.Consumer spending was flat in August, the weakest showing in five months. And factories have struggled as businesses have put off investing in new machinery, computers and other equipment.Still, a recent private survey found that manufacturing expanded in September after shrinking in August. Orders for factory goods jumped, suggesting that output may rise further.Consumers also appear increasingly confident about the economy, which could stimulate a rebound in spending. Consumer confidence reached a nine-year high last month.Retailers are expecting robust spending for the holiday shopping season. The National Retail Federation projects that holiday spending will rise 3.6 percent this year from last year. That\u2019s better than last year\u2019s gain and slightly above the 3.4 percent average since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009.The economy expanded at just a tepid 1.1 percent annual pace in the first six months of the year. Still, economists have forecast that growth accelerated to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annualized pace in the July-September quarter.The slower growth hasn\u2019t led employers to cut back on staffing. Applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, fell on average last month to a 43-year low.Big Government, Big Journalism, Economics, Federal Reserve, Jobs Numbers, unemploymentComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

McCabe7 Oct 2016Washington0CNN plays up Trump\u2019s Polaroid frolic while ignoring\u00a0the sexual escapades and other scandals that peculated from the\u00a0Bil Clinton White House\u00a0in the very same time period.For the record, Trump was not accused of any wrongdoing. In fact the Playmates and and other Playboy employees described him as a good-humored professional, who responded to Playboy\u2018s invitations. Trump was a single man at the time.Of course, Trump\u2019s real crime is that he is the 2016 Republican nominee for president.Check out the salacious details CNN lays out:In that video \u2014 a 1994 VHS tape obtained by CNN titled \u201cPlayboy Centerfold\u201d \u2014 Trump takes part in Playboy magazine\u2019s search for its 40th anniversary Playmate.The scenes featuring Trump do not contain nudity or sexually explicit content, but other scenes in the movie depict fully nude women seductively rubbing themselves in different scenarios.In one scene, Trump interviews a potential model, asking her what qualities she possesses that would make her the right choice for the 40th anniversary cover.\u201cI believe that it\u2019s not just beauty, I think it\u2019s an attitude,\u201d the model says. \u201cI think it has a lot to do with personality and an attitude. I think Playboy really represents that, and I believe that I have that, and I have what it takes to represent them.\u201d\u201cWell I think you have what it takes too,\u201d Trump replies. \u201cAnd I think everyone in this room thinks you have what it takes also.\u201dAnything else, CNN?How about what else was going on a four-hour drive south in 1994?How about Paula Jones coming forward in 1994 to accuse Clinton of sexually propositioning her while she was an Arkansas state employee and he was governor.There were more scandals in those years of the Clinton administration, but none of them brought the nation to a halt like the the president\u2019s two-year affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.It was the relationship with Lewinsky that led to Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment and it was that relationship that forever stained the Oval Office, the president\u2019s study, the hallway between the Oval Office and the study and the restroom adjacent to the Oval Office.Seems a bigger deal that a few Polaroids.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Cable News Network, Donald J.

Pollak7 Oct 20160Olivia Nuzzi of the Daily Beast, for example, wrote that \u201cat some point in the last quarter century, Klein lost his goddamn mind,\u201d and that \u201che just makes shit up, and it\u2019s not even good.\u201d She cannot prove anything in the book is made up, of course \u2014 she simply chooses to believe\u00a0that it is.Klein has been a journalist for nearly six decades\u2014seven of those years as foreign editor of Newsweek, ten years as the editor in chief of the New York Times Magazine (during which time the magazine won the first Pulitzer Prize in its history), and twenty-seven years as a contributing editor of Vanity Fair. Hence the nastiness with which his books about the Clintons, including the latest, are greeted by the media: he is an apostate of journalism\u2019s left-wing political faith, and must be punished.The media that otherwise applauds the\u00a0fanciful behind-the-scenes drama in supposed tell-all books like Game Change, which ridiculed Sarah Palin and was turned into an HBO movie in time for the 2012 elections, dismisses\u00a0Klein\u2019s reporting on Hillary Clinton.But Klein\u2019s books about Hillary have featured exclusive interviews and news-breaking stories that other journalists have found hard to match. In\u00a0many cases, these interviews and stories have proven to be illuminating \u2014 and often prescient.In The Truth About Hillary (2005),\u00a0Klein was the first journalist to prove that Hillary knew about Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky long before it became public, and that when the story broke she tried to pretend she was shocked.\u00a0He also\u00a0documented the original source of Hillary\u2019s radical politics, the Reverend Don Jones, Hillary\u2019s youth minister, who gave Hillary a subscription to motive, a leftwing publication that favored Cuba, socialism, and the Black Panthers. She would go on to write her senior thesis at Wellesley about radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, corresponding with Alinsky himself.In\u00a0The Amateur (2012),\u00a0Klein unmasked Valerie Jarrett\u2019s shadow presidency and her infighting with Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. He also\u00a0revealed Obama\u2019s rift with\u00a0Oprah Winfrey, who declined\u00a0to campaign for Obama in 2012. The book came out in May; the New York Daily News reported on September 3 \u2014 nearly three months later \u2014 that Oprah would skip the Democratic National Convention. Later, in August, Klein\u00a0reported\u00a0that Obama offered the 2012 vice presidential spot to Clinton, a story that was confirmed a year later by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann\u00a0in their book Double Down.In\u00a0Blood Feud\u00a0(2014),\u00a0Klein was the first journalist to report on the jealousy and antipathy that divide the Obamas and the Clintons. The hatred between the Clintons and Obamas was substantiated two years later, on September 16, 2016, when Colin Powell\u2019s emails were leaked to the public. Klein also reported, correctly,\u00a0that Hillary knew from the beginning that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was carried out by an affiliate of al Qaeda. And he\u00a0was the first journalist to uncover the true story of Hillary\u2019s fainting spell and concussion while she was secretary of state, anticipating new doubts about her health.Nuzzi calls Klein\u2019s books \u201cnarrative fiction,\u201d which\u00a0better describes Hillary Clinton\u2019s stories about herself.\u00a0Clinton\u2019s more egregious biographical whoppers \u2014 the Tuzla dash, for example \u2014 are largely buried and forgotten, while the media spends months lending undue credibility to her\u00a0lies about a YouTube video in Benghazi, or about never sending classified material on her private email server, before finally admitting the truth and then promptly ignoring it, once she is past the worst danger.Klein relies heavily on unnamed sources, and dialogue that is reconstructed second- or even third-hand. That is fair game for criticism, as is his writing style, which tends toward the dramatic. And every journalist is bound to make a mistake or two.But many journalists, including Halperin and Heinemann of\u00a0Game Change renown,\u00a0use information from anonymous sources to tell important stories that otherwise would go unreported.\u00a0Why are their stories about Sarah Palin widely believed, while Klein\u2019s stories about Hillary Clinton are treated as toxic until proven true?The answer is too obvious to require explanation.Joel B.

And in fact, I think Trump saved my life, because looking at that field of candidates, I mean, I was hoping that Mitt Romney was going to get in. He was the best on immigration and, you know, a respectable person. He was good on China and their currency manipulation, and he was the best that we have ever had until Trump. But without him in the race, I just thought, \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t defend any of these guys.

How does that fit for you?Well, the strange thing is that they are not different on policy. As I point out in my book, the American people are voting on the issues, while these alleged intellectuals and our party leaders say they are voting on substance. \u201cNo, we think that he is tacky. We can\u2019t support him.\u201d But you know, Mr. Romney, this is what you said about China. You are the one with the self-deportation. You are the one who wanted to protect American jobs.

(Also since dropped \u2014 Hillary\u2019s losing enough Democrats to Trump without reminding them that he\u2019s not a \u201creal Republican.\u201d)(7) His \u201ctone.\u201dAll that\u2019s already been priced into the Trump brand. What new results do the media expect from telling us that Trump not only insulted Rosie O\u2019Donnell, but also insulted Hispanic Mattress Girl, Alicia Machado: baby mama to a Mexican drug lord?The only advance in the narrative is that the octaves of journalists\u2019 voices keep getting higher, as they repeat the exact same attacks on Trump.Each time, the media claim victory by asserting with bland certainty that any drop in Trump\u2019s poll numbers is because of something very upsetting to journalists, but which is generally quite popular with voters \u2014 the Mexican rapists speech, the Muslim ban, and his response to the choleric Muslim, Khizr Khan.The media can tell us where the candidates stand in the polls. They can\u2019t tell us why. Nonetheless, they insist on identifying the precise statement of Trump\u2019s that has caused any setback, which always happens to be whatever the media is being hysterical about.Most absurd was the widely repeated claim that Trump\u2019s \u201cinsult\u201d of GOLD STAR DAD Khizr Khan caused him to dip in the polls. Except the problem is: (1) He didn\u2019t insult Khan; and (2) anyone who occasionally leaves his apartment realizes that no one would have minded if he had.Khan\u2019s son was one of 14 Muslims to die serving in the U.S. military, which, coincidentally, is the precise number of American soldiers who have been killed\u00a0by\u00a0Muslims serving in the U.S. Military.At the Democratic Convention, Khan waved a copy of the Constitution, asking Trump, \u201cHave you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words, \u2018the right of all Muslims in the world to move to America shall not be abridged!\u2019\u201dActually, that\u2019s not in the Constitution. Incomprehensibly, Khan told Trump to look for the words \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cequal protection of law\u201d \u2014 words that are noticeable for not mentioning \u201cthe right of all Muslims in the world to move to America.\u201dHe rounded out his harangue saying to Trump: \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing and no one!\u201dIn an article titled \u201cIre for Trump as He Derides Muslim Parents,\u201d The New York Times described Trump\u2019s response to Khan as \u201cstartling,\u201d and said it \u201cdrew quick and widespread condemnation.\u201d This included a tweet from Bush speechwriter Peter Wehner, calling Trump \u201ca man of sadistic cruelty. With him there\u2019s no bottom. Now go ahead and defend him.\u201dI must have accidentally been out of the country for a few days because I missed the part where Trump insulted the Khans.But according to the Times, Trump was \u201cderid(ing)\u201d the Khans when he went on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and called the snarling Muslim a \u201cnice guy,\u201d wished him luck, wondered why his wife didn\u2019t say anything, and talked about the reasons Americans might want to hit the pause button on mass Muslim immigration.To wit, Trump said:\u201cWell, I would say, we have had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism, that\u2019s what I\u2019d say. We have had a lot of problems where you look at San Bernardino, you look at Orlando, you look at the World Trade Center, you look at so many different things. You look at what happened to the priest over the weekend in Paris, where his throat was cut, 85-year-old, beloved Catholic priest. You look at what happened in Nice, France, a couple of weeks ago. I would say, you gotta take a look at that, because something is going on, and it\u2019s not good.\u201dI understand why the media are upset that Trump mentioned these notable contributions of Muslim immigrants, but unless I don\u2019t know the country at all anymore, I do not believe a majority of Americans minded one bit.The media are betting that after 9/11, the diaper bomber, the shoe bomber, the Boston Marathon, Fort Hood, Chattanooga, San Bernardino, the Orlando nightclub, the Chelsea bombing, and the recent mall attacks in both Minnesota and Washington, the revulsion of the American public to anti-Muslim bigotry will be a HUGE factor in this election.Journalists swim in a sea of agreement. They don\u2019t stop to think that the identity politics they majored in back in college might not be popular with all Americans.Polls showed a post-convention bounce for Hillary before Trump had said word one about Khan. Perhaps their nonsense headlines about Trump attacking a GOLD STAR FAMILY also helped them in the short run.But as soon as the public found out that it was this specific family and, also, that Trump didn\u2019t attack them, voters weren\u2019t mad at Trump, but they sure were with the media.COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER\u00a0\nDISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Alicia Machado, Ann Coulter, Donald Trump, Khizr KhanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Times\u00a0and\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0were contacted by Peck, in an email chain reminiscent of GameJournoPros and JournoList.Peck, who has previously labelled Wintrich\u2019s pro-Trump photography as \u201cneofascist,\u201d\u00a0urged her peers to ignore the Trump-supporting artist\u2019s\u00a0upcoming event, which will feature art submissions from Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes, and Martin Shkreli.In an email to the chain, Peck suggested that journalists should ignore the \u201calt-right clowns\u201d and their art show.From: Jamie Peck <jamie.e.peck@gmail.com>\nDate: Tuesday, October 4, 2016\nSubject: i know you\u2019re smartHi everyone-Sorry to revive this CC nightmare (minus anyone claiming to be Martin Shkreli) but the topic is relevant and I don\u2019t want to add fuel to the fire by writing about it publicly.Some alt-right clowns (Shkreli included) are having an art show in New York this weekend in the hopes of causing a media circus.\nhttp://www.papermag.com/pro-trump-art-show-williamsburg-brooklyn-2029015793.html\nHow about we make like we did with this email chain and ignore it until it goes away?\nHave a sparklingTuesday. :)The\u00a0email went out to more than three hundred journalists from a range of British and American publications, including\u00a0TIME,\u00a0Vice, The New York Times, New York Daily News, New York Magazine, The New York Post, The L.A. Times, L.A Mag, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, The Daily Mirror\u00a0The Huffington Post, Mic.com, BuzzFeed, Deadspin, Business Insider, The Verge, TechCrunch, The Daily Dot, Gadgette, and Tech Insider.Broadcast journalists were also present on the list, which included reporters, directors, and managers from MSNBC, CNBC, BBC, CNN, and ESPN.One employee of the Associated Press, a strategy manager, was also present on the list.Breitbart\u00a0contacted all journalists on the email chain, including Peck, to confirm the authenticity of the email and to gauge their opinion on the ethics of attempts to coordinate coverage across multiple journalistic outlets.Most journalists on the email chain did not reply to our request for comment, but there were a few exceptions. When asked to confirm the authenticity of the email,\u00a0Colin Pinkham, a contributor to Jezebel, Wonkette, Uproxx and Fusion told us this:I can confirm that id rather shove a red hot cactus up my ass than ever say anything that might in any way benefit the douchehats at Breitbart.Dell Cameron, a reporter for the Daily Dot, got back to us with a similar, though less graphic reply.I can confirm that\u00a01.609 is a good number to multiply mileage by if you\u2019re trying to figure out approximately how many kilometers you\u2019ve driven.Miles Klee, an editor at the Daily Dot, was more detailed in his flippancy.That email did indeed come from Jamie Peck, and everyone on the resulting thread\u2014several hundred editors and writers in all\u2014agreed not to cover the art show in question. Furthermore, some of us have decided to go to the art show anyway (in secret, of course) and fart on the art. I am one of these volunteers, but my conscience is beginning to gnaw at me. Is this ethical? Will it even accomplish anything? I am adrift and looking for any answers. Thank you for exposing this nefarious plot, and godspeed.Eventually, serious replies began to trickle in. One journalist, who wanted his name and publication kept off the record, confirmed that the he \u201cdid get the email\u201d and that \u201cit comes from an email address I believe to be Peck.\u201dAnother journalist, from a mainstream web publication, confirmed that they also received the email, although they were slightly baffled as to why. \u201cYeah it\u2019s real.\u00a0We all received it. I don\u2019t know why the fuck I\u2019m on that thread and I don\u2019t why the fuck people keep emailing it. But I did. It\u2019s real.\u201dTed\u00a0Scheinman, an editor for the\u00a0Pacific Standard,\u00a0also confirmed that he believed the email to be from Peck, although he argued that because the email chain emerged out of happenstance, there was nothing nefarious about it or Peck\u2019s use of it.Oh yes, I assumed the email was legitimate, though I myself don\u2019t know Jamie Peck \u2013 \u2013 one of the many odd things about this list is that it includes a seemingly random group of web and magazine writers, many (or most?) of whom didn\u2019t know each other before the original email, and who also (I think) work on vastly different beats from one another. Some aren\u2019t journalists at all.\u201dI didn\u2019t in the least read Peck\u2019s email as pressuring collusion, still less as the start of some dark coordinated effort. Remember that this isn\u2019t a curated list of likeminded journalists; it\u2019s an assortment of people brought together purely because one of these guys (Shkreli) spammed us a handful of times in a bid for press and general attention. (I suspect he would say it was merely to ruin our day, or something.)So the list began as this weird random web thing and continued in that vein \u2013 \u2013 hardly a secret group of journalist co-conspirators. Christ, there\u2019s at least one sex worker on the email list; she wrote in and made it clear that she had no desire to be counted among journalists. I liked that response a lot.According to our information, no journalist on the list has responded to Peck\u2019s request with support or disavowal, which makes it difficult to tell who among them are following her lead on the\u00a0proposed blackout. Judging by the responses of the Daily Dot and Jezebel contributors however, there\u2019s no shortage of anti-conservative sentiment among the journalists on the list.What we do know is that no publication named on the list has covered Wintrich\u2019s upcoming event, which is politically newsworthy and features a number of high-profile figures from media and business.A comprehensive list of the publications contacted by Peck is copied below. We will not reveal the names or email addresses of the individual journalists contacted at this time.At the time of writing, none of the contacted publications have covered Wintrich\u2019s art show.Disclosure: This author has previouly contributed an article to TechCrunch, which is one of the publications named in this\u00a0list.Correction: Mic.com did cover a story related to Lucian Wintrich\u2019s art exhibition, about a planned fundraiser for LGBT veterans.\u00a0You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.\u00a0Email tips and suggestions to abokhari@breitbart.com.Big Journalism, Milo, Tech, Alt Right, Death And Taxes, Jamie Peck, Lucian Wintrich, Martin Shkreli, Milo YiannopoulosComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

At one point, he interjected: \u201cOur plan is like Ronald Reagan\u2019s plan from 1986.\u201d (Note to Democrats: the Reagan plan failed.)Later, when the moderator asked why Putin would respect a Trump-Pence administration, Pence answered: \u201cStrength.\u201d Kaine, unable to restrain himself, blurted out: \u201cBusiness deals.\u201d His smirk\u00a0betrayed his conviction that he had just scored points, even though the moderator had to instruct him \u2014 for the third time, at least \u2014 to wait until it was his turn to speak.Kaine seemed not to understand how un-serious\u00a0he looked.

Pollak4 Oct 20160Columnist Charles M. Blow led\u00a0with that inflammatory accusation on Monday\u2019s opinion page:Donald Trump is a domestic terrorist; only his form of terror doesn\u2019t boil down to blowing things up. He\u2019s the 70-year-old toddler who knows nearly nothing, hurls insults, has simplistic solutions for complex problems and is quick to throw a tantrum. Also, in case you didn\u2019t know it, this toddler is mean to girls and is a bit of a bigot.Blow did not define what he meant by \u201cterrorist.\u201dThe episode recalls one in 2011, when columnist Joe Nocera called the Tea Party movement \u201cterrorists\u201d:You know what they say: Never negotiate with terrorists. It only encourages them.These last few months, much of the country has watched in horror as the Tea Party Republicans have waged jihad on the American people. Their intransigent demands for deep spending cuts, coupled with their almost gleeful willingness to destroy one of America\u2019s most invaluable assets, its full faith and credit, were incredibly irresponsible. But they didn\u2019t care. Their goal, they believed, was worth blowing up the country for, if that\u2019s what it took.The\u00a0Times editorial page appears to be holding a name-calling competition. Tuesday\u2019s paper featured Roger Cohen opening in a similar style to Blow, albeit with a slightly less inflammatory epithet:Donald Trump is a thug. He\u2019s a thug who talks gibberish, and lies, and cheats, and has issues, to put it mildly, with women. He\u2019s lazy and limited and he has an attention span of a nanosecond. He\u2019s a \u201cgene believer\u201d who thinks he has \u201cgreat genes\u201d and considers the German blood, of which he is proud, \u201cgreat stuff.\u201d Mexicans and Muslims, by contrast, don\u2019t make the cut.Joel B.

Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: TRUE.Not only did foreign governments and foreign donors give to the Clinton\u2019s family charity, but the majority of people outside of the government who met with Clinton while she was in office were Clinton Foundation donors, according to the Associated Press.The ultimate proof of Pence\u2019s claim? The Clinton Foundation has grudgingly said that it would no longer accept foreign contributions if she became president.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In fact, former President Clinton\u2019s exact words on Monday were as follows:So you\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.CNN reports Clinton realized his mistake and tried to walk his comments back the following day:Look, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good, and the 50-something efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake. We, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90% of our people. But there is a group of people \u2014 mostly small business owners and employees \u2014 who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can\u2019t get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they\u2019re not in big pools, so they have no bargaining power.by Katie McHugh4 Oct 2016In his June 16, 2015 speech announcing his run for the presidency, Donald Trump said the following: When do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they\u2019re killing us economically.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems.Thank you. It\u2019s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we\u2019re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They\u2019re sending us not the right people.It\u2019s coming from more than Mexico. It\u2019s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it\u2019s coming probably\u2014 probably\u2014 from the Middle East. But we don\u2019t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s got to stop and it\u2019s got to stop fast.Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U.S.-Mexico border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. As Breitbart Texas has extensively documented, it\u2019s common for human traffickers to \u201cto sexually assault or rape the females\u201d en route to the U.S., and the smugglers \u201cusually remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree\u2014a rape tree.\u201d Furthermore, it is true that as the U.S. suffers from a massive heroin epidemic that killed over 47,000 people in 2014 alone, \u201cnearly all\u201d of the heroin consumed in the U.S. is smuggled in by Mexican traffickers, as the Washington Post found. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent operation. \u00a0UPDATE: Later in\u00a0Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate, while trying to attack Trump\u2019s detailed immigration policy proposals, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine again claimed that Donald Trump and Mike Pence said \u201call Mexicans are bad.\u201d\u00a0Fact Check: FALSE. These words have never been uttered by either the Republican presidential nominee or vice presidential nominee. Again, Trump specifically criticized the rampant criminal activities committed by illegal aliens coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, many of whom are Mexican nationals.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.The stop-and-frisk policy dates back to a 1968 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed police to stop and frisk in individual based on a reasonable suspicion that he or she is armed and dangerous and may be involved in a crime. The policy has been constitutional for nearly four decades. During that time, and especially during the last two decades (until the last two years), relationships between police and communities have improved.\u00a0After Bill de Blasio became mayor of New York in 2014, that city dropped stop-and-frisk. That coincided with a precipitous decline in the relationship between police and communities. If stop-and-frisk were the cause of the friction, ending that policy would have resulted in better and more harmonious relationships. Stop-and-frisk has nothing to do with the present controversy.by Frances Martel4 Oct 2016\u201cDid you know Iran\u00a0was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?\u201d Kaine asked, adding later, \u201cUnder Secretary Clinton\u2019s leadership\u2026 [the United States] worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.\u201dThere is no evidence that the Islamic Republic of Iran has abandoned its nuclear ambitions, and subsequent revelations of secret \u201cside deals\u201d as part of the greater JCPoA exposed the fact that Iran may be able to double its uranium enrichment capacity after a decade.The Iranian nuclear deal was\u00a0signed in July\u00a02015. A year later, the Associated Press\u00a0published the provisions\u00a0hidden in a document not publicly available previously, which elucidated what would happen to the Iranian nuclear program\u00a0after the first ten years of the agreement\u2019s implementation. According to that document, Iran will be allowed to begin \u201creplacing its mainstay centrifuges with thousands of advanced machines.\u201d While it will ultimately possess fewer centrifuges to enrich uranium with, these machines will be so efficient, the AP notes, that \u201cthey will allow Iran to enrich at more than twice the rate it is doing now.\u201dA report\u00a0released this September by the\u00a0Institute for Science and International Security found that the deal will also allow, through an exemption, Iran to keep 50 tons of\u00a0heavy water\u00a0and \u201ccontinue operating 19 \u2018hot cell\u2019 radiation containment chambers.\u201dPossessing materials such as enriched uranium and heavy water does not necessarily mean Iran will have the capacity to restore its nuclear program. The deal will\u00a0not allow nuclear inspectors to confirm, however, whether or not Iran is complying with the deal. Iran got negotiators to agree that no U.S. nuclear inspectors will be allowed on Iranian soil.Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has done little to calm those alarmed by the possibility of Iran having access to advance uranium enrichment technology. Shortly after the signing of the deal, he published a book titled\u00a0Palestine, in which he argues that Iran has a role to play in the destruction of Israel, and so must work to create and possess the strongest weapons possible.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In May, Trump said he thought minimum wage levels should be left to the states, and offered the opinion that the current minimum wage sounds too low for workers to make a decent living. Later, in August, he expressed support for raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour, but still preferred to let state governments handle the issue.\u201cI have seen what\u2019s going on. And I don\u2019t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I\u2019d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don\u2019t forget, the states have to compete with each other,\u201d Trump said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on May 8, 2016.Asked by NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd if he thought the federal government should set a minimum wage floor, Trump replied:No, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re working. It is a very low number. You know, with what\u2019s happened to the economy, with what\u2019s happened to the cost. I mean, it\u2019s just\u2013 I don\u2019t know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.In August, Trump told Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News that he still does not believe there \u201chas to be\u201d a federal minimum wage, but added, \u201cI would leave it and raise it somewhat. You need to help people. I know it\u2019s not very Republican to say.\u201dWhen O\u2019Reilly proposed a $10 minimum wage, Trump replied, \u201cI would say 10. I would say 10. But with the understanding that somebody like me is going to bring back jobs. I don\u2019t want people to be in that $10 category for very long. But the thing is, Bill, let the states make the deal.\u201dTrump has maintained this position in several subsequent comments: he believes the minimum wage should be raised to $10, but the states should do it, not the federal government.by AWR Hawkins4 Oct 2016He used the example of the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech attack to make his point. During that attack a gunman walked into gun-free zones on the Virginia Tech campus, shooting and killing 32 innocents. What Kaine failed to mention is that the Virginia Tech gunman passed a background check for his firearm.\u00a0And the Virginia Tech gunman is not an anomaly among mass public attackers, Breitbart News previously reported that the vast majority of public attackers\u2013and alleged attackers\u2013of recent memory all acquired their guns via background checks. These include:In addition to these examples, Paris, France, has extremely comprehensive background checks\u2013even more comprehensive than those in California\u2013yet they also suffered 12 shot and killed during the January 7, 2015, Charlie Hebdo attack and lost another 130 innocents killed during a November 13, 2015, firearm-based terror attack in the city.The bottom line: Kaine\u2019s statement that background checks \u201cmake us safer\u201d is only true if you dismiss all the instances in which they haven\u2019t.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.Donald Trump has never made the U.S. alliance with Israel conditional. Period. That part of the statement \u2014 \u201cONLY work together with Israel if\u2026\u201d \u2014 is 100% false.As for the phrase \u201cbig league,\u201d Trump did use those words \u2014 but not specifically in relation to Israel. He was talking, in general, about countries that America defends.\u00a0Israel is not one of them: the U.S. provides money for Israeli defense, but does not defend Israel directly.\u00a0Here is Trump\u2019s exact quote, as reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency:At a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Monday, the Republican presidential front-runner was asked whether he believed the Israeli government should pay for American defense, as he had called for other U.S. allies, such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia, to do.\u201cI think Israel will do that also, yeah, I think Israel do \u2014 there are many countries that can pay and they can pay big league,\u201d Trump responded.\u201dLater that day, Trump gave a well-received speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) annual policy conference.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In fact, as CNN Money noted in a July profile of Pence, he was a \u201cleading fiscal conservative\u201d during his 12 years in Congress, and \u201cbacked various efforts to reform Social Security in a bid to make the program solvent for the long term and to reduce government spending.\u201d As CNN Money noted, one of those reform plans was proposed by President George W. Bush. Pence and other conservatives had \u201cpreviously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush\u2019s \u2013 one that would have phased in faster and let workers put more of their payroll taxes into private accounts.\u201dIt is a common liberal caricature of these proposals to claim they would have wiped out Social Security, but this is merely hysterical rhetoric, of the sort deployed against all serious reform efforts. Allowing workers the option to put some of their money into private accounts would not have \u201crepealed\u201d or \u201cdestroyed\u201d Social Security; those who proposed such reforms were explicitly attempting to save the system, which is unquestionably heading for insolvency, according to the Social Security trustees themselves.CNN Money also recalled Pence stating that cuts to Social Security payments, or increases to the retirement age, were \u201con the table\u201d in 2010. \u201cI think everything has to be on the table. I\u2019m an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu,\u201d Pence declared.Most politicians, including most Democrats, make similar statements about looking at all options to keep Social Security solvent for as long as possible. President Barack Obama proposed cuts to Social Security benefits in his budget for fiscal 2015, for example. Raising the retirement age is frequently discussed as a way to keep the system running as the U.S. population ages, although the idea is always controversial. As for Donald Trump, he has said, \u201cI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cas our demography changes, a prudent administration would begin to examine what changes might be necessary for future generations.\u201dby Frances Martel4 Oct 2016\u201cThe terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because\u00a0Bin Laden is dead,\u201d Kaine argued, receiving the question to answer before rival Mike Pence. \u201cThe terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because the Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped,\u201d he added, arguing that U.S. troops are also safer because there are \u201cnot 175,000 in a dangerous part in the world, there\u2019s only 15,000.\u201dThe death of Al Qaeda head Osama bin Laden with little strategy\u00a0for what to do with the beheaded jihadi organization has led to the terror group splintering into multiple factions. Al Qaeda in Iraq, once led by former terror camp leader\u00a0Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, evolved into what is now known as the Islamic State, led by self-appointed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Al Qaeda affiliated militia\u00a0al-Nusra Front\u00a0has officially severed from its parent terrorist group in Syria, and continues operating as a jihadist terror group under the name \u201cJabhat Fateh al-Sham.\u201dDespite parenting new, deadly terror threats, Al Qaeda itself remains\u00a0extremely formidable, expanding out of terrorist attacks and into \u201cdrug trafficking\u00a0affiliated with Mexican drug cartels, kidnapping for ransom, smuggling of arms, wildlife, coal, oil, gas, timber, precious metals, and people.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThis has enabled them not only to become independent but also richer and more powerful,\u201d according to a\u00a0Global Terrorism Index (GTI)\u00a0report.Al Qaeda has also cemented itself in regions destabilized during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, notably\u00a0Libya\u00a0and\u00a0Yemen.Kaine\u2019s claim that the Iranian nuclear deal (the \u201cJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u201d \u2013 JCPoA) eliminates the Iranian nuclear program entirely has been\u00a0proven inaccurate.The Chairman of the 9/11 Commission has said that the threat of terrorism worldwide is\u00a0greater in 2016 than in 2001. For a numerical analysis,\u00a0the Global Terrorism Index (GTI)\u00a0documented\u00a032,685 terrorist-caused deaths in 2014, compared to slightly over 5,000 in 2001.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In truth, Pence said Putin was a \u201cstronger leader\u201d than Obama, which is very different from Kaine\u2019s characterization of his remarks.\u201cI think it\u2019s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that\u2019s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president,\u201d Pence said during an interview with Dana Bash of CNN, responding to a question about Donald Trump making a similar comment the previous evening at the Commander-in-Chief forum. Pence also noted Trump \u201csaid last night he doesn\u2019t particularly like the system\u201d in Russia. by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.Kaine used a repeated \u2014 and made-up \u2014 Obama administration talking point, citing supposed \u201cexperts\u201d inside Israeli intelligence who back the Iran deal.\u00a0In August, the Israeli government responded directly to Obama\u2019s claim \u2014 which Kaine, regrettably, repeated.As the Times of Israel reported:A top minister close to Netanyahu, meanwhile, directly contradicted Obama\u2019s assertion that Israeli security officials now back the accord. \u201cI don\u2019t know to which Israelis he (Obama) spoke recently. But I can promise you that the position of the prime minister, the defense minister and of most senior officials in the defense establishment has not changed,\u201d Tzachi Hanegbi told The Times of Israel.\u201cThe opposite is the case. The time that has elapsed since the deal was signed proved all our worries that, regrettably, we were justified before the deal was made,\u201d said Hanegbi, a minister who works in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and who until recently chaired the Knesset\u2019s powerful Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.\u00a0The Defense Ministry used more emotive language to contradict Obama.\u201cThe Israeli defense establishment believes that agreements have value only if they are based on the existing reality, but they have no value if the facts on the ground are the complete opposite of those the deal is based upon,\u201d the Ministry said in a statement.Later, Kaine repeated his claim, citing Gadi Eizenkot, one of Israel\u2019s military leaders. Eizenkot was cautiously optimistic about the deal when it went into effect, but did not say that it had stopped or eliminated Iran\u2019s nuclear program, nor even that it prevented an Iranian nuclear weapon. He said that the deal \u201chas many risks, but also presents many opportunities.\u201d That is far from Kaine\u2019s claim.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check:\u00a0FALSE.It is not a new claim \u2014 and left-leaning Snopes.com had the chance to review it earlier in the year, declaring it a \u201cmixture\u201d:\u00a0WHAT\u2019S TRUE: The charity ranking site CharityWatch grades the Clinton Foundation as an \u201cA\u201d and the Red Cross as an \u201cA-.\u201dWHAT\u2019S FALSE: The larger and more highly regarded Charity Navigator has refused to evaluate the Clinton Foundation after an early 2015 dispute over bad press and allegations of a lack of transparency; on 1 September 2016, Charity Navigator reinstated the Foundation\u2019s rating.Snopes.com adds: \u201cHow much credence one should afford these rankings is debatable, however. Charity Navigator is the much larger and more highly regarded site.\u201dIn addition, Charity Navigator had put the Clinton Foundation on a \u201cwatch list,\u201d partly due to concerns over donations from foreign governments during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State. It reinstated the Clinton Foundation, conveniently, in time for the 2016 presidential election.The integrity of the American Red Cross has never been in question. Not so, the Clinton Foundation.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016Kaine claimed to be proud of the boycott at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not dumb, I knew not going to the speech might make some folks mad with me \u2013 there would be a political price, but I felt so strongly as a matter of principle that this was done in an entirely inappropriate way,\u201d he told Forward, denouncing Netanyahu\u2019s speech as \u201cdone purely to try and influence the Israeli elections and demonstrate American support for one person and one party.\u201dKaine was particularly incensed by Netanyahu\u2019s criticism of the Iran nuclear deal \u2013 the same deal he now claims Israel supports.\u201cKaine worked behind the scenes to try to delay the speech, but when that failed, was among the first Democratic senators to announce that they would not attend the address,\u201d the Times of Israel reported in July.The New York Sun had little patience for Kaine\u2019s claims to have \u201cpaid a price\u201d for his stance: \u201cAs for the price Mr. Kaine has supposedly paid for his willingness to boycott Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s speech, he can now count his selection as his party\u2019s vice presidential nominee. What a cost.\u201dThe Sun declared that Clinton\u2019s choice of \u201cone of the eight Democrats who boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s address last year to a joint meeting of Congress\u201d as her running mate was \u201cone marker of the fact that for all Mrs. Clinton\u2019s protestations of support for the Jewish State, it would be a fool\u2019s wager to count on her when the chips are down.\u201dby Jerome Hudson4 Oct 2016What Senator Kaine failed to mention is that the governor of Virginia during Johns\u2019 walk-out was a Democrat named John Stewart Battle.Johns was\u00a0protesting Virginia\u2019s\u00a0segregated\u00a0public school systems.\u00a0It was in 1951 when a 16-year-old Johns walked out of her\u00a0Moton High School, an\u00a0all-black school in\u00a0Farmville, Virginia, which sat across the street from an all-white high school.\u00a0Battle, who was elected Virginia governor in 1950, was known widely as a\u00a0segregationist\u00a0\u2014 and he governed as such.\u00a0According to the\u00a0Encyclopedia of Virginia, \u201cwhen the\u00a0National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, demanded the desegregation of state parks, Battle raised the possibility of closing them instead.\u201dby Jerome Hudson4 Oct 2016This is absolutely false.Indeed, during Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy on Wednesday\u00a0August 31\u00a0in Phoenix, the\u00a0Republican presidential nominee promised the audience that on \u201cday one\u201d the \u201c2 million\u00a0riminal aliens now inside of our country\u201d are \u201cgone.\u201dTrump\u00a0said\u00a0his administration will have \u201czero tolerance for criminal aliens.\u201dThe portion of\u00a0Trump\u2019s immigration speech\u00a0where he talks about deporting illegal aliens can be found below:According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens.\u00a0We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.That is not unconstitutional. That is current U.S. immigration policy. We prefer some countries over others. That is constitutional, lawful, and logical.There is no U.S. constitutional provision providing equal protection for people based on national origin \u2014 certainly when they are not yet in the United States!Kaine went further, saying that it was unconstitutional for Donald Trump to \u201ckeep them out if they\u2019re Muslim.\u201d Trump has since softened that stance somewhat, and now wants to keep people out from terror-prone countries. But regardless, the constitutional protection against religious discrimination does not apply to people who are not yet immigrants, residents or citizens.In fact, our current immigration policy \u201cdiscriminates\u201d against Muslims because it does not permit people to bring over their spouses from polygamous marriages, which are permitted in many Muslim countries. That kind of discrimination is constitutional and lawful.It would, arguably, be appropriate for the U.S. to discriminate in favor of some religions \u2014 such as Christians and Yazidis \u2014 who are subject to discrimination and persecution in the Muslim world.Regardless, it would be constitutional to do so.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: MOSTLY TRUE.Pence is right, according to a report from the Heartland Institute, a conservative policy organization.\u00a0His claim might, however, understate the role of the Second World War, which jump-started the economy \u2014 not through spending, but by relaxing many of the restrictions that had slowed recovery from the Great Depression.So others say it is simply the slowest since World War II, or 1949. Regardless, it has been slow.Kaine\u2019s numbers, by contrast, fell short. He claimed that the Obama administration had created 15 million jobs \u2014 a claim that only works if you ignore the first year of Obama\u2019s presidency, when unemployment continued to rise. Kaine overstated the number of jobs created by some 5 million.None other than the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, disputed the Clinton campaign\u2019s \u201c15 million jobs\u201d talking point: \u201cClinton frequently indicates that she\u2019s talking about the entire Obama administration. She uses phrases such \u2018than when they took office\u2019 or \u2018in the last 7 1/2 years.\u2019 But that\u2019s 5 million jobs too many.\u201dAnd that\u2019s without looking at the decline in household wealth, the rise in the number of Americans who have dropped out of the labor force, and the staggering national debt that produced virtually nothing, jobs-wise, for $10 trillion in deficit spending.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Fact Check, Hillary Clinton, Mike Pence, Tim KaineComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Moreover, they use numbers from last year, where Chicago homicides were far lower than they have been in 2016, to make their case.In other words, instead of comparing Indianapolis\u2019 144 murders in 2015 to Chicago\u2019s 468, The Daily Beast\u00a0compares the cities\u2019 2015 murder rates: 16.9 per 100,000 in Indianapolis, 16.7 per 100,000 in Chicago. Again, however, this completely ignores the fact that there have been 564 murders in Chicago so far this year, according to the Chicago Tribune\u00a0(and it is only October 4).Nevertheless, The Daily Beast contends that Pence ought to be called out for signing a bill that allows concealed carry permit holders to keep guns in their cars in school parking lots for self-defense and also \u201cfor\u00a0arranging for the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard in carrying concealed weapons.\u201dThe Daily Beast is also critical of Pence\u2019s actions which \u201clegalized sawed-off shotguns,\u201d but they fail to note that his actions simply brought Indiana into line with federal law: that people who wish to own a sawed-off shotgun have to go through an extensive background check\u2013including photographs and fingerprints\u2013and have to pay $200 for a federal tax stamp.While calling for Pence to be grilled on Indiana gun violence, The Daily Beast inexplicably points out that Gary, Indiana used to be \u201cknown as the murder capital of America.\u201d That changed on Pence\u2019s watch and even The Daily Beast admits one cause behind the drop in homicides is that \u201ccriminals [in Gary] have joined the exodus for better opportunities elsewhere.\u201dAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Yes they do,\u201d he said, addressing an anniversary event in Berlin via videolink.On why WikiLeaks was holding back for now, he added that \u201cif we\u2019re going to make a major publication in relation to the United States at a particular hour, we don\u2019t do it at 3:00 am,\u201d referring to the time in the eastern United States.He also said that \u201cwe hope to be publishing every week for the next 10 weeks,\u201d promising documents on the subjects of war, arms, oil, Google and mass surveillance.Assange \u2014 speaking from the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he has been holed up for over four years to avoid being extradited to Sweden to face rape allegations \u2014 hailed WikiLeaks for releasing 10 million documents over the past decade, exposing state and corporate secrets.He pledged that WikiLeaks would seek to expand its activities with extra staff and new media partnerships, with plans to hire 100 more journalists over the next three years.\u201cWe\u2019re going to need\u2026 an army to defend us from the pressure that is already starting to arrive,\u201d said Assange, wearing a black T-shirt with the word \u201ctruth\u201d on it.On the eve of the US Democratic Party convention in July, WikiLeaks published some 20,000 internal emails pointing at an apparent bias of its leaders for Clinton during the primary campaign.Assange charged that WikiLeaks was now the target of a witch hunt orchestrated in particular by Clinton, likening it to the repression of American communists in the 1950s driven by then senator Joseph McCarthy.Assange said WikiLeaks would scale up to \u201camplify our publications and to defend us against what is really a quite remarkable McCarthyist push in the United States at the moment, principally by Hillary Clinton and her allies because she happens to be the person being exposed at the moment\u201d.Asked whether he felt affinity with Clinton\u2019s Republican rival Donald Trump, he said: \u201cI feel personal affinity with all human beings.

I know this\u2013believe me (to channel my inner Donald). Part of what I do for a living is prepare people\u2019s taxes in the Washington, DC area. As an Enrolled Agent, I run into all sorts of clients. The most political (that is, horse race/hot take) clients compete with performing artists for the least amount of knowledge when it comes to taxes. I\u2019ve even had some of them forget to bring their W-2s to a tax session.That ignorance was on display in vivid colors over the weekend. We were told that this tricky NOL was some sort of \u201cloophole\u201d that only super-rich bad guys like Donald Trump got to use. We were told that this relieved him of having to pay taxes for 18 years, a laughably arbitrary, made up number that is the tautological output of simple arithmetic and wild assumptions.In fact, a net operating loss is very common in businesses. As Alan Cole of the Tax Foundation\u00a0pointed out this morning, about 1 million taxpayers had an NOL in 1995. It results from business deductions exceeding business income in a particular year. Under tax rules, this loss can be carried back up to two years, and carried forward up to twenty years. If this is a \u201cloophole,\u201d what are these political reporters suggesting? That a business loss should simply be eaten by the taxpayer? That Uncle Sam should be a full partner in your profits but not in your losses? How is that fair?We also heard that real estate depreciation\u2013of all things\u2013was a loophole! Could anything be more mundane and ordinary on business tax returns than depreciation deductions? Under the consumption tax base that I and virtually all conservatives support, depreciation would be supplanted by first year full expensing (which, ironically, would cause NOLs in most cases when it comes to structures).

This was followed by local TV at 46% and CNN at 45%.Only 39% of Baby Boomers listed Facebook as their primary news platform, preferring local TV at 60% and mainstream media outlets NBC and Fox at 47%.\u201cHBO host John Oliver achieved the destruction of Donald Trump on 29 February 2016. At least,\u00a0according to the Daily Beast,\u201d wrote Scott Bixby for the Guardian on Saturday. \u201cFansided, a popular social news aggregator, dates Trump\u2019s destruction at 1 August while\u00a0the Daily Good\u00a0called it for 21 March.

Pollak2 Oct 20160As Seth Mandel of Commentary notes, the timing of the article is odd: most of the Jewish \u201ctargets\u201d of the piece will be offline.But in the waning hours before the holiday, there is time still to point out the obvious, glaring flaw in Ben Wofford\u2019s article: it completely ignores the obvious and explicit antisemitism that is directly connected to\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.Examples abound. There was the Democratic National Committee\u2019s attempt to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is Jewish,\u00a0over\u00a0his religion. There is Hillary Clinton\u2019s embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement, whose platform accuses Israel of \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2014 an antisemitic claim that turns the victims of the Holocaust into its perpetrators. And there is Clinton\u2019s efforts to promote the writings of Max Blumenthal, an antisemite who is the son of her close associate, Sydney Blumenthal.On a policy level, Clinton backs the disastrous Iran deal, which has sent billions of dollars \u2014 including ransom money \u2014 to a regime that not only promotes Holocaust denial and the hatred of Jews, but which continues to target Jews around the world in terror attacks. And as First Lady, she embraced Yasser Arafat\u2019s wife as\u00a0the latter accused Israel of using poison gas to kill Palestinian women and children.\u00a0As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton faithfully carried out President Barack Obama\u2019s policy of \u201cdistance\u201d from Israel, whose latest snub involved\u00a0\u201ccorrecting\u201d a White House press release about Shimon Peres\u2019s funeral to deny that Jerusalem is, in fact, the capital of Israel.That is not a record of standing up to antisemitism. On the contrary, Clinton has encouraged\u00a0it.Wofford\u2019s case rests entirely on the claim that there are antisemites who support Trump. He ignores the antisemitism among Clinton\u2019s supporters.Lena Dunham, for one, published an article last year titled: \u201cDog or Jewish Boyfriend? A Quiz.\u201d The father of the Orlando terrorist turned up behind Clinton at a recent rally in Florida. And it is no accident that pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activists were in full force at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. They know their party.\u201cI support Palestinian human rights\u201d \u2013 protest signs inside the arena at #DNCinPHL pic.twitter.com/h9D40XoXzo\u2014 Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) July 25, 2016The Politico article treats antisemitism as if it were a new phenomenon, emerging in the 2016 campaign. Has Wofford been on a college campus recently? Antisemitism has been exploding, primarily as a by-product of vicious anti-Israel campaigns.At the University of California Davis last year, Muslim students taunted Jewish students with shouts of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d at a student government meeting. Later, swastikas were found spray-painted on a Jewish fraternity. That was long before Trump.StandWithUs via FacebookThere is certainly antisemitism on the right \u2014 largely online, tweeted by anonymous trolls. The antisemitism on the left is real\u00a0and concrete.But Democrats show little interest in stopping it; indeed, their primary concern is how best to\u00a0turn the vehement activists of the anti-Israel, antisemitic far-left into volunteers and voters.Not a word of that made its way into Politico\u2019s story, which is best described as a partisan smear \u2014 and an attempt to cover up the real nature\u00a0of antisemitism in America today.Joel B.

Someone who thinks like me.\u201d\u00a0The implication is clear: that a woman who recently went through a tough time and is recovering from mental health issues is the prototype for the millions of Americans supporting Donald Trump.The Post sent its \u201cnational enterprise reporter\u201d Stephanie McCrummen, 2015 winner of the Erikson Prize for Excellence in Mental Coverage by the Media, into \u201ca living room in western Pennsylvania\u201d to watch the Republican National Convention with the woman and her boyfriend, presumably with the couple\u2019s consent.The woman disputes the idea that she needed to be hospitalized in the first place.\u00a0McCrummen\u00a0reports:The first time she had seen him, at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a \u201crant,\u201d a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled \u201cmedical problem,\u201d a doctor had typed \u201chomicidal ideation.\u201dMelanie thought the whole thing was outrageous. She wasn\u2019t a person with homicidal ideation. She was anxious, sure. Enraged, definitely. But certainly not homicidal, and certainly not in need of a hospital stay.\u201cIt never crossed my mind that I\u2019m losing it,\u201d she said several months after her release, and a big reason for this conviction was the rise of Donald Trump, who had talked about so many of the things she had come to believe \u2014 from Obama being a founder of the terrorist group ISIS, to Hillary Clinton being a co-founder, to the idea that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have been murdered in a White House plot involving a prostitute and a pillow.The woman\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump is recorded in detail:\u201cHere comes Big Daddy,\u201d she said, clapping. \u201cThe Donald. Big Daddy.\u201dKevin was snoring.\u201cHere he is, babe,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald\u2019s here, babe.\u201dTrump walked onto the stage, chanting \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Donald \u2014 USA, baby,\u201d Melanie said to the Republican nominee for president, who began his speech by marveling at all the Americans who had gotten him here.\u201cWho would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16th of last year we \u2014 and I say we, because we are a team \u2014 would have received almost 14 million votes?\u201d Trump said, looking out on the cheering crowd.\u201cI would,\u201d Melanie said to the TV. \u201cI would, Donald.\u201dThe article closes with a very clear implication about the woman\u2019s \u201chead.\u201d\u201cYou winning?\u201d she said, but Kevin was drifting off again, and as Trump went on about \u201chow the system is rigged,\u201d and \u201cwounded American families\u201d and \u201cour own struggling citizens,\u201d Melanie said yes, yes, yes, over and over again, until Trump reached the final three words of his speech.\u201cI love you,\u201d he said.\u201cHe really does love us,\u201d Melanie said, and soon, the balloons were dropping, Trump was waving to the crowd, and she was switching off the television. She didn\u2019t need to hear any more.\u201cIt\u2019s finished,\u201d she said of the 2016 presidential election, in which she was sure Trump would triumph and more and more people across the country would at last see the truth. \u201cIn my head, anyway.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald TrumpComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The filings show a net loss of $915,729,293 in federal taxable income for the year.That Trump was losing money during the early to mid-1990s \u2014 a period marked by bankruptcies and poor business decisions \u2014 was already well established. But the records obtained by the Times show losses of such a magnitude that they potentially allowed Trump to avoid paying taxes for years, possibly until the end of the last decade.Trump\u2019s campaign released a statement on Saturday lashing out at the Times for publishing the records and accused the newspaper of working to benefit the Republican nominee\u2019s presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.\u201cThe New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,\u201d the campaign said, calling Trump \u201ca highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.\u201dThe statement added that Trump had paid \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in other kinds of taxes over the years.Since 1976, every major party presidential nominee has released tax returns. Clinton has publicly released nearly 40 years\u2019 worth, and Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has released 10 years of his tax returns.But after initially saying that he would make his returns public during the course of his campaign, Trump switched course, citing what he said were years of ongoing IRS audits and the advice of his attorneys to keep them private as those audits proceed.Former IRS officials have expressed skepticism that anyone would be audited so frequently, and they and other tax experts say there\u2019s no prohibition on Trump releasing his returns even if he is.In its story, the Times said the three pages of documents were mailed last month to a Times reporter who had written about Trump\u2019s finances. A postmark indicated they had been sent from New York City and the return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower, the newspaper said.Trump\u2019s campaign did not directly address the authenticity of the excerpts from Trump\u2019s tax filings. Former Trump accountant Jack Mitnick, whose name appears as Trump\u2019s tax preparer of the filings, confirmed their authenticity, the newspaper reported.\u201cThis is legit,\u201d Mitnick told the newspaper.The Times said a lawyer for Trump argued that publication of the records would be illegal because Trump had not authorized their disclosure.Because of provisions in the tax code that allow wealthy individuals to offset their personal income with losses in various partnerships and business ventures, Trump could have used his losses in 1995 to avoid incurring tax liabilities on as many as three years of prior and 15 years of future profits.The $916 million in losses reported by the Times would not include previous years of losses incurred by Trump while his New Jersey casino empire slid into bankruptcy.In an interview, Mitnick told the Times he had sometimes found it odd that the tax code allowed Trump to live in such luxury without paying income taxes.\u201cHere the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,\u201d he said.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Taxes, Donald Trump, New York TimesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak2 Oct 20160The implication, reinforced by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on\u00a0State of the Union on Sunday morning, is that Trump \u201cavoided\u201d paying taxes, when in fact his tax liability was zero.But the\u00a0Times itself has \u201cavoided\u201d paying taxes \u2014 in 2014, for example.As\u00a0Forbes noted at the time:\u2026 for tax year 2014, The New York Times paid no taxes and got an income tax refund of $3.5 million even though they had a pre-tax profit of $29.9 million in 2014. In other words, their post-tax profit was higher than their pre-tax profit. The explanation in their 2014 annual report\u00a0is, \u201cThe effective tax rate for 2014 was favorably affected by approximately $21.1 million for the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.\u201d If you don\u2019t think it took fancy accountants and tax lawyers to make that happen, read the statement again.New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Trump on Sunday, telling\u00a0NBC News\u2019\u00a0Meet the Press that Trump was a \u201cgenius\u201d in business who was simply doing what the tax code allows every American to do by counting losses against tax liabilities, and bouncing back from failure to success.That would include the\u00a0New York Times \u2014 which, however, is still struggling.As Jazz Shaw of HotAir.com\u00a0notes, the\u00a0Times\u00a0\u2014 or whoever was its source \u2014 likely obtained Trump\u2019s tax document illegally.The ongoing IRS scandal, in which the federal government targeted conservative organizations, involved\u00a0several cases in which the agency illegally shared taxpayer information with other branches of government, and in one case leaked taxpayer information to a conservative organization\u2019s political opponents.In 2008, the confidential tax information of Joe \u201cthe Plumber\u201d Wurzelbacher, who emerged as a critic of then-Sen. Barack Obama, was leaked illegally by an Ohio state official.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Pollak2 Oct 20160Clinton\u2019s comments, recorded at a fundraiser in McLean, VA in February and published by the Washington Free Beacon, also included several other digs at Sanders and his fans, saying that he was offering them a \u201cfalse promise.\u201d But Sanders, far from taking offense, confirmed Clinton\u2019s condescending remarks.Clinton had said (emphasis added):Some are new to politics completely. They\u2019re children of the Great Recession.\u00a0And they are living in their parents\u2019 basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don\u2019t see much of a future.Appearing on CNN\u2019s\u00a0State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Sanders said (emphasis added):Well, I agree with her. What she is saying is what I suggested a moment ago. There are young people who went deeply into debt, worked very hard to get a good education, and yet they are getting out of school and can\u2019t find decent, paying jobs. And that is\u00a0a major problem. They are living in their parents\u2019 basements. So that\u2019s the point there. So I personally do believe we do need a political revolution. That we do need to transform this society; create decent, paying jobs, make sure Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes; do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change; transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do; raise the minimum wage to a living wage; and have pay equity for women. So I think that Secretary Clinton \u2014 and by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago, she is prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration. And\u00a0on top of that, unlike Donald Trump, she understands that Citizens United\u00a0Supreme Court decision is undermining American democracy. It has got to be overturned. She will be supporting the constitutional amendment to do that so that billionaires cannot continue buying elections in this country.Asked by Tapper what he would say to a supporter who found it condescending to be described as a \u201cbasement-dwelling barista that is buying false promises from Bernie Sanders,\u201d Sanders said that supporters should choose between the candidates based on their positions on the issues.Joel B.

In July,\u00a0PolitiFact staff writer\u00a0Linda Qiu\u00a0published a piece full of\u00a0factual errors, glaring inaccuracies, and omissions.Breitbart News published a\u00a0full-scale 13-point refutation of the last Politifact Uranium One piece, which the latest one references.Kertscher\u2019s piece, however, is more of the same sloppy script.Several of the\u00a013 refutation points still apply to this latest \u201cfact-check\u201d article, but below are two additional points that deserve attention:1. It\u2019s true that the\u00a0Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has nine agencies that approved the sale of American uranium reserves. However, only one of those agencies, the Hillary Clinton-led State Department, employed a person whose family foundation collected\u00a0$145 million from investors in the deal \u2014 an alarming conflict of interest.2. PolitiFact says, \u201cGiven that Russia doesn\u2019t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One\u2019s assets in Kazakhstan, the world\u2019s largest uranium producer, our colleagues said.\u201dHowever, according to The New York Times,\u00a0that is patently false.As The New York Times\u00a0reports,\u00a0\u201cThe commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellow cake\u00a0to Canada even though it does not have an export license.\u201dThe\u00a0Times\u00a0report continues:Mr. Christensen, 65, noted that despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license \u2014 which they do not have \u2014 yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada.Asked about that, the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that \u201cto the best of our knowledge\u201d most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan. At the moment, with the uranium market in a downturn, nothing is being shipped from the Wyoming mines.The \u201cno export\u201d assurance given at the time of the Rosatom deal is not the only one that turned out to be less than it seemed. Despite pledges to the contrary, Uranium One was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and taken private. As of 2013, Rosatom\u2019s subsidiary, ARMZ, owned 100 percent of it.Read\u00a0PolitiFact\u2019s most recent \u201cfact check\u201d in full here.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\u00a0@JeromeEHudson.Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Pre-Viral, 2016 presidential race, big journalism, Clinton Cash, Hillary Clinton, Politifact, Uranium OneComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak30 Sep 20160The scathing editorial, \u201cBystanders to Genocide,\u201d repeats what Breitbart News observed even before Power was confirmed in 2013 \u2014 that she was doing nothing to stop the slaughter in Syria, in deference\u00a0her political masters.The\u00a0Journal notes that Power built her career as a pundit, and later as a policymaker, through her published works on the Rwandan genocide \u2014 and American neglect:Ms. Power knows something about barbarism and responsibility. In 2001 she published a searing account in the Atlantic about the Clinton Administration\u2019s failure to stop the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, in which as many as 800,000 Tutsis were killed over three months by their Hutu neighbors.Ms. Power spared no one in her depiction of the Administration\u2019s \u201calmost willful delusion\u201d about the killing, its diplomatic prevarications to avoid using the word \u201cgenocide,\u201d and its concern with how U.S. intervention would play in the midterm elections. She was particularly tough on U.S. officials who \u201cwere firmly convinced that they were doing all they could\u2014and, most important, all they should\u2014in light of competing American interests and a highly circumscribed understanding of what was \u2018possible\u2019 for the United States to do.\u201dThe essay was titled \u201cBystanders to Genocide.\u201d Ms. Power later expanded the article into a book, \u201cA Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide,\u201d for which she was widely praised. Barack Obama read the book and promoted her rise in government.Now, however, the Journal notes,\u00a0\u201cMs. Power can sound like those officials she once scolded for thinking they were doing everything they could given the complexities of the situation.\u201d It slams\u00a0some of her recent excuses for inaction, such as the complexity of the war on the ground.The war was\u00a0far\u00a0simpler when Power (and President Barack Obama) had the chance to\u00a0take decisive action, both in the early days of the Arab Spring in 2011 and after Syria violated Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons in 2013.The\u00a0Journal concludes that \u201cPower\u00a0has become an echo of the officials she once denounced for justifying American inaction in the face of mass slaughter. The honorable decision would be to resign.\u201dBreitbart News urged Power to resign in 2013, when she was still a national security adviser at the White House, in charge of a useless committee called the Atrocities Prevention Board that did nothing about Syria.The\u00a0Journal now agreed.

Pollak30 Sep 20160Donald Trump had just taken over the pageant, and fought to deal with the fallout.Hillary Clinton has, for months, planned to use that episode against him, training Machado for the attack. Here are the facts.1. Trump fought to save Machado\u2019s Miss Universe title, and her job. What is a sensitive feminist male boss supposed to do if a female employee \u2014 hired, again, for her appearance \u2014 gains a large amount of weight? He is supposed to defend her job. And that is exactly what Trump did, urging the pageant not to fire her, and appearing with her at a gym to offer support. In an excerpt from his book The Art of the Comeback, Rush Limbaugh noted Thursday, Trump recalled the episode:\u201cFirst, she wins. Second, she gains fifty pounds. Third, I urged the committee not to fire her. Fourth, I go to the gym with her in a show of support. Final act: She trashes me in the Washington Post \u2014 after I stood by her the entire time. What\u2019s wrong with this picture? Anyway, the best part about the evening was the knowledge that next year she would no longer be Miss Universe. What\u2019s maddening is that I supported her.\u201cEven in Palm Beach, where I haven\u2019t always gotten the greatest press, Shannon Donnelly, society columnist for the Palm Beach Daily News,\u201d known here as the Shiny Sheet, \u201cwrote, \u2018Here\u2019s a new one for the Donald: Protector-Advocate for large women. His acquisition from ITT has put Alicia Machado under the Trump Aegis. The Donald, bless his heart, doesn\u2019t want to fire her because \u201cit would be a terrible message to send.\u201d He is instead bringing her to the spa at Mar-a-Lago where she can work out in earnest, eat sensibly and generally decompress.\u2019 That sounds pretty gentlike to me.\u201d2. A Venezuelan judge accused Machado of threatening to kill him. From a 1998 news report: \u201cMachado, who grabbed world headlines for nearly losing her crown after a sudden weight gain, burst back into the limelight last month when lawyers named her as the getaway driver for her boyfriend in a shooting last November \u2026 [Judge Maximiliano] Fuenmayor, who reported the alleged threats to police, said he traced the caller through an incoming call identity function on his mobile telephone.\u201d The New York Post repored at the time that Machado \u201cwas seen driving the car in which her boyfriend, Juan Rodriguez Reggeti, sped away after shooting his brother-in-law in the head in Caracas on Nov. 21,\u201d citing the victim\u2019s family\u2019s lawyer. (He survived.) Machado denied the charges, which were later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence.3. Machado damaged her own reputation by having sex live on television. In 2005, Machado appeared on The Farm, a Spanish-language version of the Big Brother program. She had sex with the host of the show, even though she was engaged to Major League Baseball player Bobby Abreu of the Philadelphia Phillies at the time. Abreu called off the wedding after the humiliating episode aired on TV. Machado wrote of\u00a0her new lover, according to the Sun: \u201cHe treats me like a goddess, he f***s me like a b****!\u201d In 2006, she became the first Miss Universe to pose nude for\u00a0Playboy, appearing in\u00a0Playboy Mexico.4. The Clinton campaign has been coaching Machado for months to attack Trump. From the Washington Post:Operatives in Brooklyn had been working with Machado since the summer. They had a video featuring her story ready to go. Cosmopolitan had a photo spread of her draped in an American flag \u2013 to go with a profile \u2013 in the can. Machado had also conducted an interview with The Guardian that was \u201capparently embargoed for post-debate release,\u201d according to Vox. And the Clinton super PAC Priorities USA turned a digital ad to highlight the insults by early afternoon.5. Machado did, in fact, gain weight during her reign as Miss Universe. The Economist reported that she put on \u201c15 kilos within weeks of winning her title.\u201d Other newspapers called her \u201cThe Incredible Bulk.\u201d What was at issue was not her weight or appearance, but that she had just won a competition in which she voluntarily submitted herself to be judged for both \u2014 against hundreds of other contestants who would have taken her place. The Orlando Sentinel wrote: \u201cNo one, of course, raised an eyebrow when Machado basically starved herself before the competition. But when she gained anywhere from a reported 22 to 50 pounds afterward, she caused quite the international stir.\u201d Trump denies calling her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d or \u201cMiss Housekeeping,\u201d as Machado now claims (though he is on record at the time having called her an \u201ceating machine\u201d). Machado told the\u00a0Miami Herald\u00a0that before the beauty pageant,\u00a0\u201cI was anorexic and bulimic, but almost all of us are.\u201dJoel B.

The\u00a0latest average, as of Sep. 24 \u2014 prior to the first presidential debate on Sep. 26 \u2014 has Trump ahead of Clinton by 2%.Earlier in September, the\u00a0Times was declaring Ohio \u201can essential swing state,\u201d where Governor John Kasich threatened to destroy Trump\u2019s presidential hopes by withholding his endorsement and denying Trump\u00a0his turnout operation. The\u00a0Times added: \u201cNo candidate since 1960 has made it to the White House without winning Ohio. And while Mrs. Clinton could afford to lose there given her advantage in other battlegrounds like Virginia and Colorado, Ohio is a must-win for Mr. Trump.\u201dNow that Trump is winning the \u201cmust-win,\u201d the\u00a0Times has revised its view of Ohio\u2019s importance: \u201cAfter decades as one of America\u2019s most reliable political bellwethers, an inevitable presidential battleground that closely mirrored the mood and makeup of the country, Ohio is suddenly fading in importance this year,\u201d writes Jonathan Martin, who notes that Clinton has basically conceded the state.\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s unyielding anti-trade campaign and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s difficulty energizing Ohio\u2019s young voters have made it a lesser focus for Democrats this year, even as it remains critical to Mr. Trump\u2019s path to the White House,\u201d he explains (emphasis added).That bit of revisionist history is necessary to avoid drawing the alternative conclusion, which is that Trump\u2019s success in the bellwether state of Ohio could portend success elsewhere as well.Joel B.

Williams, Ph.D.30 Sep 20160Progressive Christian churches that have adopted inclusivity as their defining virtue find themselves ill-equipped to oust a member, even when that member has overtly rejected the fundamental tenets of the faith.Ordained in the Canadian United Church in 1993, the Rev. Gretta Vosper slowly began doubting the truths of Christianity until she found herself an avowed atheist, denying not only the divinity of Jesus Christ but even the notion of God altogether. All this time, however, she continued to lead her church, deemphasizing questions of the supernatural while stressing community based on secular values of inclusiveness and compassion.Reports suggest that the 58-year-old pastor has a \u201cloyal following\u201d at her Protestant congregation in suburban Toronto, which she describes as a good fit for nonbelievers \u201clooking for a community that will help them create meaningful lives without God.\u201dMeanwhile, however, even in the liberal United Church of Canada, members have begun to question the suitability of a church leader who denies God\u2019s existence, especially when her resistance to faith seems to border on provocation. Vosper has announced that it is time that the Christian church gave up on \u201cthe idolatry of a theistic god.\u201dMembers of the flock have expressed their consternation in a variety of ways, wondering aloud how a declared atheist can be allowed to lead a confessionally Christian congregation.\u201cMy understanding is that the United Church of Canada is a \u2018Christian\u2019 church based on the teachings of Jesus Christ,\u201d Pamella Fell wrote on a United Church website. \u201cWhy, why, why is she still with the UCC if she isn\u2019t a Christian?\u201dA columnist in the Toronto Star even suggested that a Christian church sponsoring an atheist minister is like \u201cAlcoholics Anonymous hosting a pub crawl.\u201dIn the face of the uproar over this glaring contradiction, a special committee of the Toronto Conference of the United Church has finally taken action, and earlier this month requested that the Church\u2019s General Council conduct a formal hearing of the case.\u201cIn our opinion, she is not suitable to continue in ordained ministry because she does not believe in God, Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit. Ms. Vosper does not recognize the primacy of scripture, she will not conduct the sacraments, and she is no longer in essential agreement with the statement of doctrine of The United Church of Canada,\u201d the divided committee said in its report.And still the United Church, which prides itself on its inclusiveness, is treating the matter gingerly, reluctant to declare anything off-limits.\u201cAt the heart of the concerns being raised is a tension between two core values, both of which are central to our identity as United Church. The first is our faith in God. The second is our commitment to being an open and inclusive church,\u201d wrote the Right Reverend Jordan Cantwell, head (moderator) of the United Church of Canada.The crux of the matter seems to be that for a church that has progressively embraced every aspect of secular culture, it has become hard to say \u201cno\u201d to anything. With a wink to the Bible, the United Church has accepted abortion and same-sex marriage and divorce and female ordination and openly gay ministers. But atheism seems a bridge too far.In other words, for the United Church, it\u2019s all right to \u201cmold\u201d your idea of God so that he (or she) can approve of homosexual sex and trangenderism and killing babies in the womb, but please don\u2019t deny the divinity outright.Then again, for Canada\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, perhaps atheism is the greatest \u201cprotest\u201d of all. \u201cFor some,\u201d wrote Rev. Cantwell, having an atheist minister \u201cis simply a natural extension of our commitment to be an open, inclusive, and questioning church,\u201d adding that \u201cdiversity in our church has been and will continue to be a source of strength.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tough on the United Church because we\u2019ve created this mantra of inclusiveness and now it\u2019s been tested,\u201d said the Rev. Don Schweitzer, a professor of theology at St. Andrew\u2019s College in Saskatoon. \u201cIt goes against the grain to tell somebody that you have to leave.\u201dFollow Thomas D.

The new paragraph still includes the correlation between Sharon\u2019s visit and the outbreak of violence, stating:\u201cConflict between Israel and the Palestinians accelerated in 2000 after a visit by the opposition leader Ariel Sharon to the sacred plaza in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.\u201dHowever, as HonestReporting.com notes, Palestinians themselves do not think that Sharon was the instigator of the Second Intifada.A few months after the incident, Palestinian Authority Communications Minister Imad Al-Faluji Al-Safir, said in a recorded interview:Whoever thinks that the Intifada broke out because of the despised Sharon\u2019s visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque is wrong. That was only the straw breaking the Palestinian people\u2019s patience. This Intifada was planned in advance, ever since President [Yasser] Arafat\u2019s return from the Camp David negotiations, where he turned the table upside down on President [Bill] Clinton.Yasser Arafat\u2019s wife Suha said the following:On the personal level, I miss him very, very much. [Our daughter] Zahwa also misses him, you can\u2019t imagine. She didn\u2019t know him. She knows that Arafat sent us away before the [Israeli] invasion of Ramallah. He said: \u201cYou have to leave Palestine, because I want to carry out an Intifada, and I\u2019m not prepared to shield myself behind my wife and little girl.\u201d Everyone said: \u201cSuha abandoned him,\u201d but I didn\u2019t abandon him. He ordered me to leave him because he had already decided to carry out an Intifada after the Oslo Accords and after the failure of Camp David [in July 2000].American diplomat Dennis Ross recounts how Israel had called on Washington to warn them that they had evidence the Palestinians were \u201cplanning massive, violent demonstrations throughout the West Bank and the next morning, ostensibly a response to the Sharon visit.\u201dWashington subsequently urged Arafat to stem the violence, but the Palestinian leader, according to Ross \u2013 \u201cdid not lift a finger to stop the demonstrations, which produced the Second Intifada.\u201dIn addition, the Mitchell Report investigating the Intifada, which was submitted to then-president George W. Bush, found categorically that \u201cThe Sharon visit did not cause the Al-Aqsa Intifada.\u201dBig Journalism, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Ariel Sharon, conflict, Error, HonestReporting, Israel, New York Times, PA communications minister, Palestinian Terrorism, second intifada, Temple Mount, ViolenceComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Cuba is not \u2014 it\u2019s not right what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s not right,\u201d Trump said at the rally.\u201cThis afternoon I spent a lot of time in Little Havana, an amazing place,\u201d he added. \u201cPresident Obama made a one-sided deal with the Castros for nothing in return. Did you ever see this guy make a decent deal for this country?\u201dThe Newsweek piece garnered a lot of mainstream media television coverage, receiving airtime on MSNBC, CNN, ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and Spanish-language outlet Univision.Some dispute the veracity of the suggestion\u00a0of impropriety\u00a0in Eichenwald\u2019s piece. According to a post on Capitol Hill Cubans, a blog edited by\u00a0Mauricio Claver-Carone,\u00a0the executive director of Cuba Democracy Advocates, there is no evidence Trump directly transacted business with the Cuban government.\u201cHowever, Trump never transacted business with the Castro regime, as the Newsweek article claims. To the contrary, Trump concluded that those who seek to do business with the Castro regime were mistaken.\u201dCapitol Hill Cubans pointed to a 1999 Miami Herald op-ed by Trump where he said human rights take priority over huge profits.Eichenwald acknowledges neither Trump nor any of the parties directly involved are likely to face prosecution because the statute of limitations ran out long ago.Instead, Eichenwald ponders how the Cuban-American voting bloc may react to this news.\u201cWhat would happen if Trump\u2019s Cuban-American supporters ever found out?\u201d Eichenwald writes at the end of his piece.Others have speculated on what this could mean for Trump in Florida as well.\u201cThe revelations come just as the Republican presidential candidate began making a big push to curry the support of Cuban-Americans who live in Miami-Dade, Florida\u2019s most-populous county with the most Republicans, 366,000. About 72 percent of them are Hispanic, nearly all Cuban-American,\u201d Marc Caputo wrote in Thursday\u2019s edition of Politico Florida\u2019s Playbook.Winning Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes is vital for both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s path to the White House. As it currently stands, both Trump and Clinton are in a dead-heat for the Sunshine State according to numerous polls.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Cuba, cuban-americans, Donald Trump, Florida, Kurt Eichenwald, melbourne, newsweekComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak29 Sep 20160Their agenda\u00a0is obvious: voters like winners, so making Clinton an even bigger winner could be a way to improve her poll numbers. But the hyperbole is helping Trump set expectations that guarantee he wins the next two debates.As this author predicted, Trump would lose the first debate, largely because Clinton\u2019s health problems\u00a0lowered expectations for her, even below where they had been for Trump. Initially, Trump faced lower expectations, because he is less experienced at debates. But after Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial, some observers wondered whether she could stand\u00a0through a full 90 minutes of debating. She did that \u2014 with nary a cough.\u00a0Moderator Lester Holt also weighed in heavily in Clinton\u2019s favor.Yet, as this author explained after the debate, Trump\u2019s loss in the first debate made it likely\u00a0that he will win the second and third debates. There are five reasons. First, Trump will now benefit from low expectations in the second debate that carry over into the third, since his first win\u00a0will still\u00a0be seen as a fluke. Second, the moderators will be under pressure to be less biased than Holt was. Third, Trump will benefit from the town hall format in the second debate, because he has spoken more often to real voters than Clinton has done recently. Fourth, Trump has home field advantage in Las Vegas for the third debate. And fifth, Trump\u2019s improvement over time will\u00a0show that he can learn\u00a0on the job, as he will have to do in the White House.Had Trump actually melted down on Monday, as the New York Times\u2018 Charles Blow pretends,\u00a0any mistakes in later debates would have reinforced that first impression. But because he was competent, even while losing, Trump set himself up for wins.Perhaps fearing a comeback, Trump\u2019s critics are trying to squeeze every possible advantage out of Clinton\u2019s win on Monday. But they are setting him up for even bigger wins \u2014 and setting Clinton up for a fall.Take, for example, Paul Waldman, writing at The Week. He predicts that Clinton will win the second debate \u2014 and his reasons come down to preconceived notions\u00a0of the candidates: Trump as a blustering fool, Clinton as not only smart but also empathic. Waldman actually declares,\u00a0without any irony, that \u201crelating to other humans one-on-one is something Hillary Clinton is actually very good at\u201d \u2014 something that we know from opinion polls is not true, and which her campaign also knows is untrue, since they do not allow it to happen often.Waldman also argues Trump is incapable of learning or\u00a0improvement. That flies in the face of Trump\u2019s improved polls since mid-August, when he became a more disciplined candidate.It also sets expectations so low Trump is certain to clear them.Joel B.
