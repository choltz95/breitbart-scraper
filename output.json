Clinton went back out onstage, said \u201cSorry,\u201d and did not explain her absence. The mystery grew: Where was Hillary?Clinton reportedly went to the ladies\u2019 room during the commercial break, according to The Boston Globe. Clinton even had a campaign employee on bathroom duty to make sure Clinton could quickly get inside the restroom and return to the stage. But when that staffer let in O\u2019Malley spokeswoman Lis Smith, Clinton waited outside.Why would Clinton not share a restroom with Smith?The gaffe was yet another embarrassment for Clinton, who stepped into trouble by falsely claiming that Donald Trump is \u201cISIS\u2019 best recruiter\u201d and that Islamic State radicals use Trump videos as recruitment tools. Clinton is also locked in a major war with the Bernie Sanders campaign over the campaigns\u2019 shared access to Democratic National Committee data.And the Clinton camp is reeling from a Breitbart News report that the DNC is really not so fair and impartial in this primary. How could it be? After all, the Clinton campaign is funding the DNC and its state-level get-out-the-vote efforts!\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary ClintonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Until now, that is.\u201cI\u2019m not super-political,\u201d he said Tuesday in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel, where he had just stopped by to meet the Bad Boy of politics, real estate developer and Republican front-runner Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday evening\u2019s latest GOP candidate debate.\u201cHe\u2019s pro-gun,\u201d Mr. Bilzerian said of Mr. Trump. \u201cSpeaks his mind. He\u2019s not politically correct.\u201dBilzerian\u2019s caption says of Trump: \u201cIn an age of pussified political correctness, you have to respect people who remain unfiltered.\u201dBecause of his macho online charisma, unabashed patriotism and devotion to wounded veteran causes, Mr. Bilzerian has built up a massive Web following. An unending stream of images of loaded guns, naked models and fast cars doesn\u2019t hurt. He boasts over 14 million followers on Instagram and nearly 10 million followers on Facebook.It is not exactly The Federalist Papers, but Mr. Bilzerian\u2019s exuberant love of American freedom comes shining through as he makes his first foray into electoral politics.\u201cI am more of a constitutionalist libertarian,\u201d he said, clearly uncomfortable talking so overtly about politics. \u201cI believe in the Constitution.\u201d Dan Bilzerian / InstagramAnd Mr. Bilzerian says he is genuinely worried about the direction of the country.\u201cEverybody is living now in fear and the only answer is more laws and more laws and more laws,\u201d he said. \u201cOn and on it goes, and once the government gets bigger it never goes back.\u201dDespite the strong feelings \u2014 positive and negative \u2014 he generates, Mr. Trump has undeniably turned the political world \u2014 starting with the GOP \u2014 upside-down, reaching far outside the pool of traditional Republican voters. He\u2019s reaching, for instance, people like Mr. Bilzerian and his many, many Internet followers.Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to these new voters is deeply worrisome for establishment Republican strategists and candidates who have enjoyed a stranglehold on their highly defined voter rolls.For six months now, GOPers have dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s huge polling advantage as a fluke. They said it wouldn\u2019t last. They said he would hit a ceiling. And now he enjoys a double-digit lead nationally over rivals, having just broken through 40 percent support among Republican voters.Now some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent critics worry that just maybe the billionaire developer is actually being underrepresented in the polls, precisely because of his appeal to voters well outside the normal Republican base, voters like Mr. Bilzerian.Dan Bilzerian / InstagramEven with one prominent recent poll showing Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, taking a lead in Iowa\u2019s Republican caucuses over Mr. Trump, GOP strategists worry that the polls aren\u2019t accounting for some of these new voters who have become so enamored of Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt talk.\u201cIt is the lack of apology, you know,\u201d Mr. Bilzerian said. \u201cJust owning who he is and just refusing to apologize because people said he should or whatever.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Dan Bilzerian, Donald Trump, InstagramComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

They\u2019re really defending the sexual revolution,\u201d Browder explained. \u201cHillary would not want to defend that if she knew what she was doing.\u201dBrowder\u2019s new book Subverted: How I helped the Sexual Revolution Hijack the Women\u2019s Movement details how the sexual revolution became part of the push for more rights for women when \u201cabortion was rammed through into the women\u2019s movement.\u201dNow 70-years-old, Browder is recalling her experience as a small town girl from Iowa going to the Big Apple to begin her writing career after studying journalism at the University of Missouri.I was a small town girl from Iowa and I was glamour struck. When I went to New York City to start my writing career, I had a choice of either going with a little magazine \u2026 or I could go with Cosmo, and Cosmo was the queen of women\u2019s magazines in those days and I went with Cosmo. One thing that I noticed when I was at the University of Missouri, we had a magazine writing class, and we analyzed different magazines \u2026 and I chose Cosmopolitan and one thing I noticed was that those anecdotes in the magazine were so pat that they seemed made up.Browder said that when she got to Cosmopolitan Magazine she found out that \u201csure enough, they were being made up.\u201d\u201cI slipped into a very bad place where I began making up stories too \u2013 to sell the sexual revolution to young women. I didn\u2019t know at the time what kind of horror would eventually result from that so I wrote this book to try to set the record straight,\u201d Browder explained. \u201cI thought if I don\u2019t set the record straight, who will?\u201d\u201cWhat women don\u2019t know is the women\u2019s movement and the sexual revolution were falsely joined together,\u201d she said, adding that before the two issues were \u201cradically different movements.\u201d Browder says her book exposes this fact for the first time.Browder said the two issues \u2013 the sexual revolution and the women\u2019s rights movement \u2013were joined together after two men convinced women at a meeting at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. to insert abortion as part of the matter of rights for women. It was at that time, the women\u2019s movement and the sexual revolution joined together when 57 out of roughly 100 people in that very meeting voted to call for a right to abortion.My message to young women is don\u2019t buy into the fact that the sexual revolution and having sex and jumping into bed every time you turn around, and all those things \u2026 don\u2019t by into that stuff that is part of the women\u2019s movement. That was separate from the women\u2019s movement and we can separate it again.\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be united,\u201d she said of the sexual revolution and women\u2019s movement. \u201cThat uniting was betrayal of women.\u201dBrowder said that part of the women\u2019s movement was the right not to be fired for being pregnant, ensuring that poor women received job training, as well as paid maternity leave being mandatory. She said those were good things that women wanted \u2013 and she knows from experience because in 1969, she was fired for being pregnant.\u201cWhat I would like for women to recognize is how propaganda works so they don\u2019t get deceived by it. Propaganda is half truth, selected truth, and truth out of context,\u201d Browder said.When asked why Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is covered differently by the media that GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, Browder said it\u2019s because of the polarization of women\u2019s issues.The media has been convinced that that joining of the women\u2019s movement with the sexual revolution is what women want \u2013 the left media. We\u2019ve polarized around this issue. The reason I think we polarized around it was because it was based on propaganda from the very beginning. We polarize around issues that we don\u2019t have the truth about.Browder added that her book reveals these issues, which been buried for nearly 50 years, saying she is \u201choping that this will change our dialogue over abortion.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Abortion, Big Government, Abortion, Cosmopolitan, Hillary Clinton, Sue Ellen Browder, women, Women's Rights, Womens MovementComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He claims that officers in Germany are putting themselves at constant risk as many of the migrants are known to have a high level of violent\u00a0behaviour\u00a0and attack police who attempt to arrest them.\u201cIf there is no pre-trial detention made, no imprisonment is imposed, and no deportations carried out then the police make multiple arrests and the perpetrators get away with it,\u201d he said and\u00a0maintained\u00a0that the migrants end up back on the streets.Mr. Wendt cited the \u201cCasablanca Report\u201d which documented some 2,244 North African migrant criminals in the city of Dusseldorf.\u00a0According\u00a0to the police union chief, the numbers for other major German cities are similar and he said that the migrant crisis has only served to reinforce numbers in the already-existing migrant criminal gangs.Last year, Mr. Wendt made a similar statement at the height of the migrant crisis. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect our law,\u201d he said and asked\u00a0why \u201cthings always have to go up in flames\u201d before politicians \u201creact\u201d.Development Minister Gerd M\u00fcller of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said that the\u00a0government\u00a0of Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel forecasts a massive increase in migrants from Africa.\u201cThe migration pressure will increase dramatically in the coming years if we do not manage to create economic opportunities in African countries,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwhat happens there has a direct impact on Europe\u201d.The findings match a report from the European Union border agency Frontex who earlier this year reported that the future of the migrant crisis was young migrant men coming from Africa to Europe for better economic opportunities rather than legitimate refugees fleeing conflict\u00a0or persecution.Breitbart London, Immigration, Europe Migrant Crisis, Germany asylum seekers, Migrant Crime, Rainer WendtComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.
