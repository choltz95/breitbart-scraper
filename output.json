She further states that the failure of Common Core developers to think through the politics of the education program allowed conservative grassroots parent and taxpayer groups to organize against it.According to the WikiLeaks email, Clinton referred to conservative parent activists who have charged that the Constitution provides for no federal role in education as those \u201cwho don\u2019t think anybody should be told anything about what to study, even if it\u2019s the multiplication tables,\u201d and who say \u201cthat should all be left to local control.\u201dClinton said:The common core is a perfect example.\u00a0I mean, the common core was negotiated by a bipartisan group of governors.\u00a0And maybe they thought \u2013 I mean, I think this was a political failure because they negotiated something and they had no real agreed-upon program for explaining it and selling it to people so that they left an opening for those who were always in the education debate, who don\u2019t think anybody should be told anything about what to study, even if it\u2019s the multiplication tables.\u00a0You know, that that should all be left to local control. And then you get into more complicated areas, as we all know, that that\u2019s just totally off limits.\u00a0 And then using common core results for teacher evaluation when everybody knew that it was going to be complicated to implement.\u201dIronically, in the same speech, Clinton also acknowledged:[U]nless you\u2019re a governor or maybe a mayor who has authority over your schools, there\u2019s not really very much that most politicians can do because of the way our system of education is governed.\u00a0Obviously, local school boards, colleges and universities, they have separate governance.\u00a0And we don\u2019t want politicians interfering too much in the independence of the governance of education.However, in a recent town hall geared to women and young people, Clinton, with her daughter Chelsea in tow, presented her view of cradle to grave federal intrusion into a \u201clife of Julia\u201d for girls and women. Clinton is a major supporter of federal assistance\u00a0for pregnancy and pre-natal care, universal pre-K, childcare, paid family leave, free college tuition and student loan forgiveness, and for single payer, government-sponsored health insurance.Clinton wants taxpayers to fund abortions for women of black and Latino ethnicity as well.Interestingly, the chancellor at University of California, Berkeley says Clinton\u2019s plan to provide free college tuition to students is a campaign pledge that is unlikely to ever be implemented.Professor Nicholas Dirks says Clinton\u2019s plan would invite unprecedented federal control over university-led research.\u201cI would love to see the Clinton administration come and make college free for students coming from families earning less than $125,000,\u201d Professor Nicholas Dirks says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\u201c[I]f such a thing came to be, there would be a real concerted effort to control parts of some of the great research institutions that are public in ways that might compromise their capacity to compete at the highest level,\u201d he added, noting as well that implementing Clinton\u2019s plan would be a \u201ccomplicated political process\u201d since state governments oversee universities.Just as with No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top \u2013 the latter of which gave us Common Core \u2013 Clinton\u2019s \u201cNew College Compact\u201d revolves around the federal government incentivizing states with federal money and perks in return for debt-free tuition for lower income students.Writing at Forbes, George Leef asserts what Dirks observes: that Hillary Clinton can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d college with more federal interference and control. Leef notes that Clinton\u2019s objective of launching more low-income students into college contains \u201ctwo mistaken beliefs\u201d: \u201cthat the cost of attending is the main reason why many students from non-wealthy families don\u2019t graduate from college and that getting a college degree would be very beneficial to them.\u201dLeef first notes that, although the cost of college has indeed risen, other low-cost options are available, such as community college \u2013 the expense for which can often be covered by Pell grants. He also says, \u201c[W]hen people shop around for higher education, almost no one is completely priced out.\u201dLeef points out, however, that cost is not the primary reason lower income students don\u2019t seek out college.\u201cThe main reason why most don\u2019t enroll isn\u2019t the cost, but rather because they aren\u2019t academically prepared for or (even if academically prepared) interested in devoting more years of their lives to formal schooling,\u201d he says. \u201cTrying to lure such individuals into college with free tuition is a bad idea.\u201dUnlike Clinton \u2013 who continually urges more federal spending in education as the nation\u2019s best \u201cinvestment\u201d \u2013 Leef states, \u201cThe economy does not automatically create more \u2018good jobs\u2019 simply because more college graduates enter the labor market.\u201d\u201cGovernment policy aimed at \u2018producing\u2019 more graduates will only mean more young people who are over-credentialed for the work available,\u201d he explains. \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t have a shortage of people with college degrees. What it does have is a shortage of jobs that pay well. Unfortunately, the Clinton plan would make that problem even worse.\u201dBig Government, Education, Hillary Clinton, Common Core, conservative grassroots, federal overreach, free college tuition, local control of education, student loan forgiveness, universal pre-school, WikiLeaksComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The poll of 500 registered voters had a 4.4 percent margin of error, and was conducted on Saturday and Sunday, so it factored in reactions to the Trump tape story, but not Sunday night\u2019s second presidential debate.The poll sample included 43 percent Democrat and Democrat-leaning, 36 percent Republican and Republican-leaning, and 12 percent \u201cstrictly independent\u201d respondents.\u201cIn a head-to-head matchup, Clinton\u2019s lead over Trump grows to 14 percent (52 percent to Trump\u2019s 38 percent),\u201d NBC reports. \u201cAnd among all registered voters, Clinton\u2019s lead is 13 points, her largest advantage over Trump since the poll began testing the pair last September.\u201dThe poll also found a seven-point advantage for Democrats on the question of which party the voters would like to see in control of Congress, up from a three-point edge for the Democrats last month.As for the Trump tape, the poll respondents said it should be an issue in the presidential race by a 52 percent to 42 percent margin. 41 percent said the remarks were \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d while 31 percent said they were \u201cinappropriate, but typical of how some men talk in private with other men.\u201dInterestingly, only 9 percent of Republicans surveyed said they wanted their congressional candidates to renounce their backing of Trump, while 14 percent wanted their other candidates to call upon Trump to drop out of the race. That\u2019s not a question any presidential candidate wants pollsters asking in October, to be sure, but weekend news coverage gave the impression both of those numbers would be a good deal higher.While both candidates remain underwater on approval ratings, Trump\u2019s negatives are up quite a bit. Hillary Clinton scored 40 percent positive versus 50 percent negative responses, while Trump\u2019s ratio was 29 percent to 63 percent \u2026 and 52 percent of Trump\u2019s negative responses were \u201cvery negative.\u201dBig Government, 2016 election, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, pollComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

She lies even when she doesn\u2019t have to.For instance, while campaigning in Iowa, she told a group of supporters that her grandparents were immigrants to the United States.\u201cAll of my grandparents, you know, came over here,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I sit here and I think, well you\u2019re talking about the second, third generation. That\u2019s me, that\u2019s you.\u201dThe story was untrue. One of her grandparents was an immigrant; three were not.Another time Hillary said, \u201cI actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before [Obama] did\u201d\u2014a statement that earned her a Pinocchio for lying from \u201cThe Fact Checker\u201d in the Washington Post.Hillary lied when she said that she \u201cdid not mail any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.\u201d It turned out that there were more than two thousand such documents on her email server\u2014twenty-two of which were marked \u201cspecial access program,\u201d a level of classification higher than top secret.She lied when she said that she employed her private email \u201cas a convenience\u201d so that she could use a single phone for both work and personal communications. It turned out that she owned several electronic devices and that, in any case, Huma Abedin carried them for her.She lied when she said she had voluntarily turned over all her work emails to the State Department. It turned out that she relinquished those emails only when forced to under subpoena, and that she withheld dozens of Benghazi-related emails she had exchanged with her back-channel fixer Sidney Blumenthal.\u201cClinton has repeated numerous times that the [email] arrangement was \u2018allowed,\u2019 though no one in the administration has ever said they approved her server,\u201d wrote The Hill\u2019s A. B. Stoddard. \u201cSo Democrats\u2014like Republicans\u2014assume she is making a misleading statement about her own unorthodox decision to do something no Cabinet secretary had ever done before.\u201dShe lied when, according to the New York Times, she told the FBI that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had advised her to conduct unclassified state business using a private email account. Powell, one of the most respected elder statesmen in the country, quickly denied the report. \u201cHer people have been trying to pin it on me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.\u201dHillary lied when she said that as secretary of state she did not grant special favors to foreigners who donated money to the Clinton Foundation. As I documented with eyewitness accounts in Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary, wealthy foreign donors who gave millions to the foundation received special treatment. One such donor was a Canadian businessman who was granted permission to sell control of 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium production capacity to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. After the deal went through, Bill Clinton was invited to Moscow to give a speech. He was paid $500,000.\u201cThe Clinton Foundation was ostensibly set up to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems,\u201d writes David Harsanyi, senior editor at The Federalist. \u201cAlthough it has done some fine work, it\u2019s most fruitful program has been leveraging [Hillary] Clinton\u2019s position in the State Department to enrich her family, friends and cronies. The foundation was a center of influence peddling. Rock stars. Soccer players. Conglomerates. Crown princes. All of them paid in. All of them expected access to the U.S. government.\u201d And most of them got it.Indeed, more than half of the private citizens who were granted access to Hillary while she was at Foggy Bottom\u201485 out of the 154 who got face time or spoke to her\u2014donated to the foundation, for a total of $156 million.The membrane that should have prevented seepage between the State Department and the foundation turned out to be totally permeable. \u201cLaura Graham, a senior executive at the foundation,\u201d reported the New York Post, left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills, Hillary\u2019s chief of staff.\u201d And when Mills wasn\u2019t taking telephone calls from Graham and doing favors for foundation donors, she was traveling to New York City to interview job candidates for a top job at the foundation.The impact of Hillary\u2019s menagerie of lies was reflected in public opinion polls. Sixty percent of Americans considered her \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d And when Gallup asked Americans what word came to mind when they heard the name \u201cHillary Clinton,\u201d a majority replied \u201cdishonest/liar/don\u2019t trust her/poor character.\u201dTo deal with this problem, her friends and campaign staffers set about trying to make Hillary more likeable.\u201cShe needs to try to humanize herself, because in some ways she\u2019s kind of become a cardboard cutout figure,\u201d said liberal historian Douglas Brinkley.But rehabilitating Hillary at this stage in her life (she turns sixty-nine on October 26) was more easily said than done.\u201cHillary still obsesses about money, a narrative thread that has existed since she was thwarted in her desire to build a pool at the governor\u2019s mansion in poor Arkansas and left the White House with a doggie bag full of sofas, rugs, lamps, TVs and china, some of which the Clintons later had to pay for or return,\u201d writes New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. \u201cEven Chelsea was cashing in, getting a ridiculous, $600,000-a-year scion salary from NBC, far greater than that of many of the network\u2019s correspondents. As a Clinton White House aide once explained to me, \u2018Hillary, though a Methodist, thinks of herself like an Episcopal bishop who deserves to live at the level of her wealthy parishioners, in return for devoting herself to God and good works.\u2019\u201dAnd the social critic Camille Paglia puts it this way: \u201cSo much must be overlooked or discounted\u2014from Hillary\u2019s compulsive money-lust and her brazen indifference to normal rules to her conspiratorial use of shadowy surrogates and her sociopathic shape-shifting in policy positions for momentary expedience.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton, edward klein, Guilty as Sin, Hillary ClintonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He spoke of the high standards to which those who call themselves Christians are called. Pence then added, \u201cWe all fall short of the glory of God, and there is no one righteous, other than the One.\u201d\u201cThe other part of my faith is, I believe in grace. I believe in forgiveness,\u201d continued Pence. \u201cWe have been forgiven.\u201dIn Pence\u2019s prior acknowledgement of Trump\u2019s apology, he expressed hope that America would see Trump\u2019s heart during the debate. Pence had also said that he was \u201cgrateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.\u201d He then said he was praying for the Trump family.On Monday afternoon in Charlotte, Pence told the crowd that during the debate, Trump indeed \u201cshowed heart, humility; then he fought back.\u201dPence moved on to speak of what the Trump-Pence administration would bring. \u201cThis election, it\u2019s not just a choice between two people; it\u2019s a choice between two futures. \u2026 I choose a stronger America at home and abroad. \u2026 I choose an America that stands up for the constitutional principles.\u201dHe spoke of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will lead to a more prosperous future. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take the advice of Hillary\u2019s husband,\u201d said Pence, referencing former President Bill Clinton\u2019s statements at a rally, where he called Obamacare crazy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to renegotiate NAFTA so it works for the American economy,\u201d said Pence.Pence went on to say that government wants to be involved in every aspect of our lives.He pivoted, then, to the Supreme Court, stating that the\u00a0next president will likely decide\u00a0the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.Pence said the U.S. \u201cmust decide here and now that the person we elect as the next President of the United States is Donald Trump.\u201d This is essential,\u201d he said, \u201cfor sake of the rule of law, the Constitution, life, Second Amendment, right to keep and bear arms.\u201d\u201cI was awfully proud of my running mate last night,\u201d Pence said, returning to the subject of Sunday night\u2019s debate. He told the crowd that the media continues to ignore the avalanche of corruptions that come out of the Clintons.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump went out on that stage last night and put the truth before the American people,\u201d Pence said. He then revisited the issues that Clinton\u2019s private foundation took millions from foreign donors as she headed up the State Department, that she destroyed emails from a private server, and her use of high technology to erase emails.Clinton\u2019s private speeches to foreign financial groups came up, as well. Pence referenced the WikiLeaks release of the emails of John Podesta, a close adviser to President Obama. Podesta was also chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton and current Chairman of Hillary for America. He spoke of the hemispheric market with \u201cOpen trade and open borders,\u201d documented in the emails, the accuracy of which the Clinton campaign has not refuted.Pence spoke of when he first got to know the Trumps during\u00a0the summer. \u201cTo know the Trumps is to know a family,\u201d said Pence.Pence told the crowd that in Donald Trump and Mike Pence they have two people who\u00a0will fight every day for the American Dream for everyone in this nation.\u201cI truly do believe that now is the time to do all that we can,\u201d said Pence, who suggested that those who are inclined could bend a knee and pray for the country.Clinton and Trump have jockeyed for the advantage, often within the statistical margin of error, in North Carolina polls in the\u00a0past several months. A Real Clear Politics average of five recent polls gives Clinton the current advantage over Trump by 2.6 percent, in part due to a late September poll that gave her a six-point advantage. The most recent poll included in that average, High Point, showed Clinton up just one point. That poll was taken from October 1-6.From the Charlotte event, Pence will continue on to hold an evening event in Fletcher, just outside of Asheville. His wife and daughter have joined him along the campaign trail on Monday in North Carolina.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, barack obama, christian, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Mike Pence, WikiLeaksComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He challenged her on her emails, her unremarkable record in the U.S. Senate, and her unsuccessful record as Secretary of State. She was defensive yet not adequately defending. Trump reminded people of a few simple facts: she represents a failed, rigged system that benefits the powerful and wealthy; policies that will make Americans less wealthy and ISIS more emboldened; a knack for lying that jumped to a whole new level on Sunday.Trump\u2019s debate win has set off a spiral amid the legacy and establishment media and sent the Clinton campaign into damage control as WikiLeaks published its second of many tranches of emails from her campaign chairman John Podesta on Monday morning.Trump has now moved past the worst stretch in his campaign, the release of a tape in which he is seen and heard making vulgar remarks about women. That set back his effort to gain momentum after his running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s win in the Vice Presidential debate over Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) a week ago.Trump is hitting the campaign trail in the key battleground states of Florida and Pennsylvania early this week as he takes the campaign that Clinton threw into the gutter back to a focus on the issues like trade, immigration, jobs, the economy and national security.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, 2016 presidential election, debate, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, KellyAnne ConwayComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

NBC was the owner of the Access Hollywo0d tape that The Washington Post\u00a0released Friday revealing the GOP nominee using direct and foul language in reference to courtship and the way women interact with celebrities.Falwell told Cosby he was upset by the tape and how it was received by members of his family, but it did not shake his support for the New York City developer.Cosby asked Falwell if his narrative was conjecture and he told her it was based on real conversations he had with people familiar with Republican conspirators.Falwell, who endorsed Trump in January, said, \u201cI just think some of the establishment Republicans\u2014I\u2019m not going to name any names, I\u2019ve got some independent information, but I\u2019m not going\u2026 I\u2019m not going to reveal it on the air\u2014but I think some of the establishment folks who reluctantly endorsed him had this planned all along as a way to slither out of the endorsement, and I think it backfired on them, and I\u2019m glad to see that.\u201dWhen Cosby pressed Falwell, he was more direct: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence that it came out right before Trump was supposed to appear with Paul Ryan at a rally, and it conveniently gave Paul Ryan a way to disinvite Trump.\u201dThe Trump surrogate said he has heard for a while from trusted Republican sources that something was being planned that would allow the GOP leaders to take Trump off the ticket.\u201cIt was just something that, that I was told was going to come down in October,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would probably result in Trump not being the nominee.\u201dListen to the complete interview here.\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Access Hollywood, Jerry Fawell Jr, Liberty University, Moral Majority, Speaker Paul D.

If convicted, he could face\u00a0up to seven years in prison on each count, as set forth\u00a0in the Illinois Compiled Statutes.The state of Illinois has had a criminal transmission law since 1989, but made the transmission of HIV a felony with a change to its statutes in 2012.The 2012 bill was a reaction to a 2009 case where one man was charged with infecting 13 women with the HIV virus.Amutavi\u2019s lawyer insisted that his client had been on a regimen of retroviral medications that made it \u201cimpossible\u201d to transmit the virus.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Big Government, Law Enforcement, Pre-Viral, AIDS, Crime, HIV, Jimmy AmutaviComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

At least it is a moral, ethical choice.If she is elected, the world does not end\u2026. Once elected, Hillary can be fought. Her tactics are blatant and juvenile, and battling her by means of political and procedural maneuvering or through the media , through public marches and online articles, all of that will be moral, worthy of man of principal [sic].Her nominees can be blocked, her proposed laws voted down.The alternative does not offer a moral person the same opportunity. If one helps to elect an immoral man to the highest office, then one is merely validating his immorality, lewdness, and depravity.But it\u2019s OK, at least it is not her! Right??No.Lee\u2019s call for Trump to step down and withdraw from the race is respectful to him and to the process.Trump stepping down does not guarantee a Clinton win, but it does guarantee that the Republican party still stands for something, still allows its members to maintain thier [sic] own self respect and that it still has a future.Beck\u2019s opposition to Trump has been unrivaled in its vociferous invective. The radio talker regularly describes Trump as a Hitler-like psychopath with supporters Beck has compared to Nazi Brownshirts.The former radio shock jock\u2019s\u00a0disdain for Trump reached a crescendo in April when he donned swim goggles and\u00a0rubbed his face in a bowl of crushed Cheetos\u00a0to see if he could \u201clook like Donald Trump.\u201dFollow Rebecca Mansour on Twitter\u00a0@RAMansour2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Glenn Beck, Hillary ClintonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But what they do reflect is the dedication and enthusiasm of a candidates\u2019 online supporters. Both candidates\u2019 fans have access to the same tools to game the polls \u2014 trolls, bots, etc. Pro-Clinton Super PAC Correct the Record has reportedly spent seven figures on online warfare. Yet Trump fans are still overwhelming the left in this facet of psy-ops, producing screenshot after screenshot of \u201cpolls\u201d showing The Donald ahead.Clinton backers know logically that this phenomenon does not necessarily affect the offline electorate, yet they still feel the need to debunk the meme \u2014 which wastes their time and energy while making them look bitter and defensive.It makes sense, then, that most national conservative sites and local news sites did another round of online snap polls, but at least a half dozen\u00a0left-leaning national outlets skipped them after the second debate.Time MagazineLast time around, Time\u2019s online snap poll went Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 42. Instead of a \u201cwho won the debate\u201d poll, the magazine bizarrely asked: \u201cWhich Presidential Candidate is Better for Your Money?\u201d The current spread on that poll is Trump 89 \u2013 Clinton 11.SlateLast time: Trump 54 \u2013 Clinton 46. This time: Hillary won. She won so much! What does all this winning mean?FortuneFortune had the slimmest margin of most high-profile online polls after the first debate, Trump 51 \u2013 Clinton 49 after 400,000+ votes. This time around, the site\u2019s editors silently skipped a shot at another 400,000 hits.The HillRound one: Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 36 \u2013 Draw 6. Round two: crickets.CBS\u00a0New YorkLast time around, CBS New York\u2019s online poll went roughly Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 42 with ~41,000 votes. Surely it is only a coincidence that the site did not conduct an online poll Sunday night.CNBCWith half as many votes and the same tight margin as Fortune\u2019s 51-49 split, CNBC must have found the result of their last online poll too demoralizing to risk a repeat.Most establishment news outlets are touting a \u201cscientific\u201d poll by CNN and ORC which says that 57 percent of debate watchers declared Clinton the victor on Sunday night. Left out of that top-line figure: 58 percent of their sample \u201csaid they were supporting Clinton before the debate [emphasis added].\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Drudge Poll, Hillary Clinton, Online Poll, Presidential Debate, Snap PollComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But Foreman added that the FBI had not decided to charge Clinton with a crime because there was not enough evidence of \u201ccollusion.\u201d Therefore, he said, Trump\u2019s claim was false.Foreman continued by examining a statement by Clinton that \u201cthere is no evidence that anyone can point to, at all \u2026\u00a0that any classified materials ended up in the wrong hands.\u201dYet Congress heard sworn testimony, several times, that people with no security clearance at all \u2014 from Clinton\u2019s lawyers, to the technicians who managed her server, to Bill Clinton aide Justin Cooper \u2014 had access to her emails, including those with classified information.That should have been enough to rate the statement \u201cfalse.\u201d But CNN rated it \u201ctrue.\u201dNBC News actually fact-checked Trump\u2019s statement as if he had actually suggested that she used chemical acid to delete the emails on her server. It rated the claim false\u00a0because \u201cClinton\u2019s team used an app called BleachBit; she did not use a corrosive chemical.\u201dFACT CHECK: Trump says Clinton \u201cacid washed\u201d her email server. She did not.\nMore #debate fact checks: https://t.co/Dow86LjY8c pic.twitter.com/G0h2MlKoi3\u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 10, 2016Apparently the use of metaphor in political speech is unfamiliar at NBC News.And NBC News\u2019 fact-checker may also need to repeat high-school chemistry: bleach is a base, not an acid.Joel B.

I\u2019m not sure any minds were changed at this debate tonight. I think so much has occurred over the last 48 hours and this last week\u00a0that people have\u00a0to digest all of this, including the debate tonight, to see where they stand.\u201d Co-panelist Mike Smerconish declared Trump the winner \u201con points\u201d: \u201cI think the night belongs to Donald Trump,\u201d he said. But Smerconish\u00a0added that Trump had fallen short, regardless: \u201cDid he grow the tent? I can\u2019t see that there was any outreach.\u201dTrump beat Clinton despite facing a three-on-one press from his opponent and from the moderators, who were at least as biased as they had been in any of the previous debates. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper fired repeated follow-ups at Trump while leaving Clinton largely alone. But he, at least, brought up tough questions for Clinton on occasion.\u00a0ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz actively debated Trump at times, and silenced the audience when it cheered for Trump \u2014 though not for Clinton.Still, Trump overcame that hostility and pressed Clinton effectively on the issues, as well as on her weakest points \u2014 the email scandal, Benghazi, and Obamacare. He was on better ground than Clinton when it came to citing facts, and he forced her into repeating the rather serious lie that the only emails she deleted from her private server were personal in nature. He also stood his ground on substantive policy questions while maintaining his cool \u2014 for the most part \u2014 when she tried\u00a0personal attacks.The media had largely\u00a0declared the presidential race for Hillary Clinton Saturday, after many Republicans criticized Trump over comments he made in 2005 about groping women. The comments were captured by a live mic and surfaced Friday. Chuck Todd, political director of NBC News, said \u201cthe presidential race is over,\u201d according to Republicans with whom he spoke. Despite Trump\u2019s debate win, the media will be\u00a0reluctant\u00a0to let go of that narrative, with many cheering for his demise.At the first debate, Trump refrained from placing any of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety in the front row, despite threatening to do so. This time, with the media and the Hillary Clinton campaign hitting Trump over his old remarks, Trump more than delivered on the threat, holding a press conference with four of Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers \u2014 who also accused Hillary Clinton of trying to silence and slander them \u2014 before the debate, and placing them in the front row.The Donald Trump that debated Hillary Clinton in St. Louis was better prepared, more passionate, and more focused on the issues than he was two weeks ago. He won, under incredible pressure.The voters will see it, even if the media will not.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Huntingdon, of \u201cClash of Civilizations\u201d fame\u00a0and a life-long Democrat and foreign policy hawk.Huntington noted in 2004 that the global elites \u201chave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations\u201d.CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT\u00a0FOR PEACEFP was bought by the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, a globalist think tank founded by internationalist Andrew Carnegie. To give further context to this, the current President is\u00a0William J. Burns \u2013 the former\u00a0United States Deputy Secretary of State (2011-14). In other words, he worked for Hillary Clinton.WASHINGTON POST\u00a0Carnegie sold FP to the Washington Post group in 2008.When the\u00a0Washington Post \u2013 which has been an integral media ally of the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2013 bought FP, it was losing around $1.3m a year. But it was considered so integral to helping push a neoconservative, hawkish foreign policy, that it was worth the loss.The chairman of the Washington Post group in 2008 was Donald E. Graham, who said of the acquisition: \u201cForeign Policy is a terrific magazine, and I\u2019m pleased it will become a part of our company\u2026 Foreign Policy furthers our commitment to great magazine journalism and gives us another opportunity to expand our journalism online\u201d.SLATE GROUPIn 2008, Foreign Policy was moved into the Slate group, the home of the left-wing Slate magazine.Slate\u2019s editor in chief is Jacob Weisberg, an NPR contributor, left-wing New Republic contributor, New York Times contributor, contributing editor to Vanity Fair, and columnist for the Financial Times.FP Group\u2019s Media Kit promotes Hillary Clinton as its foremost recent contributorGRAHAM HOLDINGS COMPANYWhen Amazon owner Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, he did not buy the loss-making Foreign Policy magazine with its declining readership. Alexa.com, which is a site ranking organisation run by Amazon itself, reveals Foreign Policy to be the\u00a09719th website in the world compared to its competitor the Economist, which is the\u00a01,935th website.Instead, the magazine stayed with the aforementioned Donald Graham, who changed the name of the Washington Post group to Graham Holdings Company to reflect the sale of the paper.The magazine now operates under the FP Group, headed up by David Rothkopf.Rothkopf, to square FP\u2019s historical circle, is a scholar of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. He was a managing director at Kissinger Associates,\u00a0former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\u2019s New York-based consulting firm which was founded alongside\u00a0Mack McLarty, President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff.But greater still, Rothkopf himself served as U.S. Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade under\u00a0the Clinton Administration in 1993, when Mr. Clinton was signing NAFTA\u00a0which Donald Trump has pledged to reform.DONALD E. GRAHAMGraham, the Chairman and CEO of the company that owns Foreign Policy magazine, is married to Amanda Bennett, a Bloomberg journalist who has just moved to Voice of America.In 2014, the pair founded a \u201cmultimillion dollar National Scholarship Fund\u201d for the children of illegal immigrants in the United States.The organisation has solicited large donations from many Hillary Clinton supporters such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Fernandez Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and a whopping $5m from Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg.\u2018BREAKING WITH TRADITION\u2019Foreign Policy magazine\u2019s claim to be \u201cbreaking with tradition\u201d in endorsing Hillary Clinton is anything but accurate.Perhaps it has never written an editorial, but its entire editorial line and history is, in and of itself, a tradition of endorsing globalist, neoconservative, pro open borders policies and candidates.The idea that this is somehow a big deal is a total farce.Follow Raheem Kassam on Twitter2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, carnegie endowment for peace, david e graham, foreign policy, Hillary Clinton, Slate, Washington PostComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

LOUIS, Missouri0ST. LOUIS, Missouri \u2014 Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, appeared with three alleged sexual assault victims of former President Bill Clinton in the hours before he debates Clinton\u2019s wife, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, here at Washington University. The women\u2014Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick\u2014have each leveled various charges against Bill Clinton. They also each have charged that Hillary Clinton was an \u201cenabler\u201d of Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior in exclusive interviews with Breitbart News\u2019 Aaron Klein published on Sunday.In addition, Kathy Shelton\u2014who was allegedly raped when she was 12 years old, while Hillary Clinton defended her accused rapist\u2014spoke as well.Before the event started, a leftist\u00a0reporter\u00a0yelled at Trump: \u201cMr. Trump, does your star power allow you to touch women without their consent?\u201dThen Trump, ignoring the reporter, opened the panel event and said: \u201cThank you very much for coming, and these four very courageous women have asked to be here and it was our honor to help them. I think we\u2019re each going to make just an individual short statement, and then we will have a little meeting and we will see you at the debate.\u201dWATCH THE VIDEO:Jones, who kicked it off, said, \u201cI\u2019m here to support Mr. Trump because he\u2019s going to make America great again, and I think everybody else should vote for him.\u201cI think they should all look at the fact that he is a good person, he\u2019s not what other people have been saying he\u2019s been, not Hillary\u2014so think about that,\u201d Jones said.Shelton then said, \u201cI\u2019m also here to support Trump.\u201d She stated that \u201cat 12 years old, Hillary put me through something that you would never put a 12-year-old through.\u201d\u201cShe says she\u2019s for women and children,\u201d Shelton added, noting that Hillary Clinton stands against women and children because she was caught \u201claughing on tape\u201d last year when asked about her case.Broaddrick went next. \u201cI\u2019m here to support Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI tweeted recently, and Mr. Trump retweeted it, that actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump may have said some bad words but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any comparison.\u201dWilley, who was the last to speak on the short panel, noted as well that \u201cI am here to support Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cThe reason for that is the first day that he announced for president he said, \u2018I love this country and I want America to be great again.\u2019 And I cried when he said that because I think this is the greatest country in the world,\u201d Willey said. \u201cI think that we can do anything. I think we can accomplish anything. I think that he can bring peace to this world. And I think Donald Trump can lead us to that point.\u201dWhen Trump wrapped the event, which was broadcast live on his Facebook page, the same reporter shouted more questions.\u201cMr. Trump, have you touched women without their consent?\u201d the reporter shouted multiple times.Jones, after the reporter wouldn\u2019t stop harassing Trump and the panel, fired back: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask Bill Clinton that? Why don\u2019t y\u2019all go ask Bill Clinton that? Go ahead\u2014ask Hillary as well.\u201dThe room erupted in applause for Jones.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, kathy shelton, Paula JonesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The overall trade deficit, including both goods and services, was lower at $500 billion. Trump has generally focused more on the deficit in goods, and the difficulty it represents for America\u2019s manufacturing sector.\nby Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUE\u201cWhen I\u00a0look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided\u00a0transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state \u2013 really, the number one terrorist state,\u201d Trump told the audience, responding to a question from the audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve made them a strong country from, really, a very weak\u00a0country just three years ago.\u201dTrump has made this claim regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), as the Iran nuclear deal is officially known, and received some criticism for it. Fact-checking websites such as Politifact have argued that Trump\u2019s claim is false because \u201cthe money is already Iran\u2019s to begin with,\u201d but not denied that this amount of money would return to the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei thanks to the deal.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0has argued that the $150 billion estimate is a fabrication by \u201ccongressional Republicans\u201d far from the real amount of money Iran would once again control.As\u00a0Algemeiner,\u00a0citing\u00a0Omri Ceren of the Israel Project, notes, the twelve-figure estimate of the money the deal would return to Iranian control came from President Barack Obama, not Republicans. President Obama\u00a0said in an interview\u00a0that Iran \u201chas $150 billion parked outside the country,\u201d arguing that not all of its funds under sanctions will be unfrozen immediately because \u201cunwinding the existing restraints\u2026 takes a certain amount of time.\u201dThis money does not include a separate\u00a0$1.7 billion\u00a0payment to the government of Iran, allegedly to atone for an arms sales agreement that never went through after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\u00a0The U.S. government\u00a0handed over that money\u00a0the same day that Iran released several American citizens imprisoned on dubious charges.Both\u00a0President Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Secretary of State John Kerry, who played a major role in brokering the Iran nuclear deal, have admitted that the Iranian regime will likely use the money to fund terrorism, particularly activity by the Shiite terrorist organization Hezbollah.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEBill Clinton was indeed impeached for lying under oath to a grand jury and obstructing justice, although he was not removed from office.After impeachment, Bill Clinton was held in contempt of court by federal Judge Susan Webber Wright, in what the New York Times described as a \u201cscathing\u201d ruling. Wright said Clinton testified falsely in his deposition about not having sex with Monica Lewinsky, and that his actions \u201csubverted the rule of law and violated Ms. Jones\u2019s right to information relevant to her case.\u201d\u201cThe court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation\u2019s President in contempt of court,\u201d Wright wrote. However, she added, \u201cthe record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiffs\u2019 questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process.\u201dClinton\u2019s law license in Arkansas was suspended for five years, and he paid a $25,000 fine. The Supreme Court also barred Clinton from practicing law before the nation\u2019s highest court.Trump made a reference to an $850,000 fine Bill Clinton paid to Paula Jones. This was, in fact, an out-of-court\u00a0settlement Clinton reached with Jones, not a fine leveled by the court.\u00a0The purpose of reaching an out-of-court settlement is to avoid an unpleasant trial that could very well end with even worse consequences, so Trump is basically correct that Clinton\u2019s conduct cost him $850,000, and he didn\u2019t want to pay it \u2013 it most certainly was not a charitable contribution! \u2013 but it technically wasn\u2019t a \u201cfine.\u201dby Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE.Just two days ago, Trump apologized publicly for comments he made on a video recorded 2005 in which he joked about groping women.\u00a0It is true that Trump tends to avoid apologizing, and that he did not apologize in some of the cases that Clinton mentioned.\u00a0He did not apologize for the Birther controversy, for example \u2014 though he has maintained that there is no need to do so, because he provoked President Barack Obama into finally producing his long-form birth certificate.Occasionally, Trump offers a sarcastic apology \u2014 as he did when he \u201capologized\u201d to Pocahontas for using her name to ridicule Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who allegedly faked Native American heritage to obtain a professorship at Harvard Law School.\u00a0And in August, he expressed \u201cregret\u201d for some of the things he had said that had offended people (including, presumably, the Khizr Khan episode, which Clinton mentioned). He avoided saying the word \u201capologize.\u201dStill, the claim that Trump \u201cnever\u201d apologizes is incorrect.by Katie McHugh9 Oct 2016\u201cOne of them is a wonderful woman, [who] at 12 years old was raped. At twelve. Her client \u2014 she represented \u2014 got him off, laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl that was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight. So, don\u2019t tell me about words,\u201d Trump said. \u00a0Fact-Check: TRUEIn the mid-1980s, journalist Roy Reed interviewed Hillary Clinton, and\u00a0a tape of that interview has been uploaded to YouTube and is available in the Special Collections Department of the University of Arkansas libraries.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe took a lie detector test! I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,\u201d Clinton said about her client Thomas Alfred Taylor, who raped Shelton in 1975, laughing.\u00a0Clinton\u00a0also laughed in the video about saving the child rapist from a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d He served one year in county jail, with two months shaved off his sentence for the time he already served. Shelton\u2019s injuries were so traumatic, she could never have children.\u00a0WATCH:\u00a0Clinton also argued in court that the 12-year-old rape victim sought out older men.\u00a0Shelton came forward after 40 years of silence, as reported by the Daily Mail:\u00a0A child rape victim says she cannot forgive Hillary Clinton for defending her rapist in court 40 years ago, saying the Democratic presidential candidate attacked her credibility despite knowing that her assailant was guilty \u2013 and later laughed about it in a taped interview.Kathy Shelton was just 12 years old when a 41-year-old drifter raped her on the side of a desolate Arkansas road in 1975.Now, four decades later, she has agreed to be named and pictured for the first time in this Daily Mail Online exclusive because she is furious that her rapist\u2019s defense attorney \u2013 Hillary Clinton \u2013 has been portraying herself as a lifelong advocate of women and girls on the campaign trail.\u2018It\u2019s put a lot of anger back in me,\u2019 said Shelton, now 54, in an exclusive interview at her Springdale, Arkansas, home in August. \u2018Every time I see [Clinton] on TV I just want to reach in there and grab her, but I can\u2019t do that.\u2019In 1975, Clinton served as the defense lawyer for Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old factory worker accused of raping Shelton after luring her to his car.Taylor pleaded down to \u2018unlawful fondling of a minor\u2019 and served less than a year in prison after Clinton was able to block the admission of forensic evidence that linked her client to the crime.Shelton also tweeted about her suffering at Hillary\u2019s hands.I don\u2019t care if Trump said gross things. I care that Hillary Clinton lied, terrorized, & mocked me, defending my rapist.\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016Hillary Clinton an advocate for women & children? Not even close.. She terrorized me during my rape case & later laughed about it. #facts\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016If I\u2019d had justice vs my rapist, maybe I could have healed. But Hillary Clinton made sure I suffered loss of justice, then laughed it off.\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016Hillary Clinton is a cold-hearted liar. The lies she told about me, 12 yr old rape victim, traumatized me nearly as much as the rape itself.\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016No little girl should suffer violent rape like I did\u2026But no grown woman should attack that little girl like @HillaryClinton did. #debate\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 10, 2016At 12 I was one of the first women Hillary Clinton destroyed, but I wasn\u2019t the last. Please put an end to this woman\u2019s career of abusing us.\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 10, 2016by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSE.Capt. Khan was an Army officer who gave his life defending fellow soldiers in Iraq, and whose parents attacked Trump in a speech at the Democratic National Convention.When asked about the speech by ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos (a former aide to President Bill Clinton), Trump made a comment about the silence of Khan\u2019s mother, who stood mute onstage alongside Khan\u2019s father.But Trump never said anything negative at all about Capt. Khan, and in fact praised his sacrifice on nearly every occasion.\u00a0Trump reiterated his praise for the late Capt. Khan in his rebuttal to Clinton: \u201cCaptain Khan is an American hero.\u201dby John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUEThe recently-leaked transcripts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches have her speaking supportively of single-payer systems, although in her public campaign pronouncements, she emphasizes \u201cfixing\u201d the problems with the Affordable Care Act. Some examples:\u201cIf you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don\u2019t have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.\u201d (June 2013)\u201cSo we\u2019re in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you\u2019re going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what\u2019s succeeding, fix what isn\u2019t, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.\u201d (January 2015)What Clinton says in public is often very different than what she tells her private speaking audiences. For example, she recently said she thought single-payer would \u201cnever, ever happen,\u201d but she was making a prediction and saying that ObamaCare repairs couldn\u2019t wait for a single-payer system to be created, not expressing her own policy preference: \u201cI want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act. I don\u2019t want it repealed, I don\u2019t want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don\u2019t want us to end up in gridlock. People can\u2019t wait! People who have health emergencies can\u2019t wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.\u201dDuring Clinton\u2019s primary run against Bernie Sanders, the New York Times found her moving to the left on health care and saying she was \u201cin favor of what\u2019s called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age.\u201d Sanders was explicitly in favor of single-payer health care\u2026 and described it as \u201cMedicare for all.\u201dby Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSE.\u00a0According to FBI Director James Comey, \u201cthe FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not among the group of 30,000 e-mails returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.\u201d\u00a0Federal investigators concluded\u00a0that Clinton\u2019s lawyers deleted nearly half of the 60,000 emails on her server.\u00a0by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: HALF TRUETrump was answering a question about Islamophobia, and while he acknowledged that prejudice against Muslims is a problem, he argued that political correctness places American lives at risk.\u00a0\u00a0He cited the neighbors of the San Bernardino terrorists \u2014 and he was correct to do so, because they did tell reporters after the attack that they had seen unusual activity, but chose not to report it for fear of being accused of racial profiling.However, the neighbors did not actually see \u201cbombs\u201d (though that was, in fact, what the San Bernardino terrorists were building in their home).So while Trump\u2019s statement about political correctness was essentially true, he was incorrect about the details.by Katie McHugh9 Oct 2016Clinton stated during the debate:\u201cI will not let anyone into the country that I think will poses a risk to us, but there are a lot\u00a0 refugees, women and children\u2026 There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely I believe because of Russian aggression, and we need to do our part. We are by no means carrying anywhere near the load Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be, from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\u201dFact-Check: FALSE (According to Clinton herself)\u00a0The Wikileaks dump revealed that Clinton herself said refugees \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d be vetted, as Breitbart News reported:\u00a0Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign to reconcile the differences between Secretary Clinton\u2019s 2013 private remarks, where she said Syrian refugees \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d be vetted, to her 2015 and 2016 campaign claims that \u201cvigilant\u201d screening and \u201cvetting\u201d of \u201crefugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,\u201d will be sufficient to safeguard American citizens from \u201cjihadists coming in along with legitimate refugees,\u201d but there has not yet been a response.We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Secretary Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan, which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees; she admits we cannot.The entire quote from Clinton\u2019s speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago\u2019s Vanguard Luncheon on October 28, 2013, included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches reads as follows:\u201cSo I think you\u2019re right to have gone to the places that you visited because there\u2019s a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it\u2019s on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can\u2019t possibly vet all those refugees so they don\u2019t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cTurkey for the same reason.\u201d\u00a0In September, a top Obama immigration official also admitted to Congress that some refugees launch terrorist plots after they\u2019ve been \u201cvetted\u201d and invited into the United States.\u00a0by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUEThis is an extremely difficult statement to fact-check, because a great deal depends on what is meant by \u201creforming the tax code.\u201d A thorough rundown of Clinton\u2019s voting records on tax issues prepared by Forbes in April 2015 reveals little in Senator Clinton\u2019s record that could be fairly described as a significant reform.In summary, Clinton voted against the Bush tax cuts, but voted for a few amendments to the bill that did not pass; she eventually voted yes to extend those tax cuts, while complaining that she thought they benefited the wealthy too much. She voted in favor of a minor alteration to the Alternative Minimum Tax, to raise the exemption, while voting against a bill that would have repealed it, something that would have been a major tax reform. At the end of her term, she tried to raise the top marginal tax rate back to its pre-Bush level, which is hardly a \u201creform\u201d of the system.by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhile\u00a0one video\u00a0published by the Al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab in Somalia uses video of Trump calling for a\u00a0\u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d Trump is largely absent from Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Hamas, and Hezbollah propaganda \u2013 the major jihadist groups who expend resources on producing propaganda to recruit fighters.Much of the propaganda released by one of the most active jihadist groups in the world, the Islamic State, focuses largely on the Quranic theme of\u00a0jihad (\u201choly war\u201d) and cites both the Quran and the Islamic documents known as\u00a0hadiths. At one time,\u00a0half\u00a0of the propaganda the group published sold potential recruits on constructing a jihadist utopia in Syria and Iraq. Much of the\u00a0media\u00a0that does not touch on the benefits of living in a society cleansed of infidels instead depicts\u00a0graphic executions, including some\u00a0performed by children,\u00a0intended to intimidate the Western world.One exception is a video in which an image of Bill Clinton captioned \u201cfornicator\u201d is used as a rallying cry to destroy America, \u201ca secular state built on man-made laws whose soldiers fight for the interests of legislators, liars, fornicators, corporations, and for the freedom of Sodomites.\u201dThe rise\u00a0of\u00a0groups like the Islamic State \u2013 formerly Al Qaeda in Iraq \u2013 has been fueled significantly\u00a0by the growing chaos in the Middle East that followed the implementation of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy since 2008. The\u00a0Obama White House\u2019s approach\u00a0to the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, the fall of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, the Houthi uprising in Yemen, and the teenaged war in Afghanistan have all left significant power vacuums from which jihadist groups have benefitted greatly \u2013 not just the Islamic State, but formerly moribund jihadist groups like\u00a0Al Qaeda. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was\u00a0critical\u00a0in implementing these policies.by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: HALF FALSEIt is true that the Birther movement started among Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters. And, as Breitbart News reported, Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, admitted that at least one member of the campaign had helped propagate the rumor (though she said that person was fired.) It is also likely true that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal shopped the story to reporters. And it is unknown how much involvement Hillary Clinton herself had with the movement.However, it is a stretch to say, as Trump did, that Hillary Clinton herself personally started the Breitbart movement, and it is incorrect to claim that her campaign manager corroborated that particular accusation.(The real truth about the Birther rumor, which the mainstream media choose to ignore, may be that Barack Obama started it himself by allowing his literary agent to claim, for nearly two decades, that he was born in Kenya.)by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEThe\u00a0New York Times\u00a0obtained Trump\u2019s tax returns which revealed that the Republican nominee\u00a0avoided paying federal income taxes by reporting losses on his 1995 tax return.Clinton criticized Trump\u00a0as the hypocritical embodiment of\u00a0\u201cthe same rigged system he claims he will change.\u201dHowever, Clinton herself has taken advantage of the same tax loopholes she\u2019s hammered Trump over.\u00a0According to Clinton\u2019s\u00a02015 tax returns,\u00a0she reported capital gains losses to lessen her tax burden through a \u201ccarryover.\u201dOn page 17, \u201cCapital Gains and Losses\u201d for \u201cWilliam J Clinton\u00a0&\u00a0Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Clintons reported a \u201clong-term capital loss carryover\u201d of $699,540. In other words,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0reported a \u201cnet long-term capital gain or (loss)\u201d of negative \u201c$699,540.\u201dDuring Sunday\u2019s debate clinton also falsely stated that Trump is \u201csomebody who maybe hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in 20 years.\u201d\u00a0That statement is also false.\u00a0The\u00a0Times\u00a0admits that Trump\u2019s\u00a0tax statements reveal that he may have\u00a0avoided paying income taxes for \u201cup to 18 years.\u201cby Frances Martel9 Oct 2016\u201cThey had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,\u201d Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked.\u00a0\u201cYou were there as Secretary of State with the so-called \u2018line in the sand.'\u201d\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, I was gone,\u201d Clinton replied.Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEPresident Obama delivered his famous \u201cred line\u201d speech \u2013 in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a \u201cred line\u201d that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences \u2013\u00a0in August 2012.\u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,\u201d President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State\u00a0from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013,\u00a0according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad\u00a0used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation.\u00a0Assad was most recently accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in Aleppo in\u00a0September 2016. He remains dictator of Syria after \u201cwinning\u201d an election in 2014.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEClinton has frequently made this claim on the campaign trail, so media organizations have already had an opportunity to vet it. In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was \u201chidden\u201d and \u201cdebatable.\u201d\u201cBy all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children\u2019s health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,\u201d said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts \u2013 which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn\u2019t be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy\u2019s office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a legislator, she didn\u2019t write the law, and she wasn\u2019t the president, so she didn\u2019t make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\u201dThat encomium hardly supports Clinton\u2019s claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband\u2019s White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe \u2013 fact-checking Clinton\u2019s claims during her primary run against Barack Obama \u2013 found that Clinton \u201chad little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.\u201dOrrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, \u201cI do like her. We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No \u2013 Teddy does, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201d (\u201cTeddy\u201d is a reference to Senator Ted Kennedy.)by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSEClinton never apologized for the statement, despite what her running mate and other surrogates have claimed.\u00a0Here is her full statement\u00a0after her remarks emerged in the media. Note that the words \u201csorry\u201d and \u201capologize\u201d do not appear in any form, and that she merely says she \u201cregret[s]\u201d using the term \u201chalf.\u201d She doubled-down on the term \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\u00a0Even the Huffington Post, openly hostile to Trump, said: \u201cClinton Stands By \u2018Deplorables,\u2019 But Walks Back The Basket Size A Bit.\u201dHuffPo noted that Clinton said: \u201cI regret saying \u2018half\u2019 \u2015 that was wrong.\u201d But she did not apologize, and the reason she responded immediately was that she had been caught.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSETrump made himself a victim of hyperbole with this statement. If he had said America was currently experiencing one of its slowest growth periods since 1929, he would have been entirely correct, but there have been a few slower periods \u2013 and, of course, a few outright recessions, or negative growth \u2013 since then.It would be playing word games to argue that the recessions shouldn\u2019t be counted, because they weren\u2019t economic growth. Even so, it wouldn\u2019t be correct to say the current growth rate is the absolute worst since 1929, although it is among the worst.It has been argued that the post-2009 recovery was the weakest of the post-war era, and that Obama\u2019s is the only presidency since the Great Depression that never reached 3% GDP growth, but that\u2019s not what Trump said.by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEDuring a\u00a0March 13,\u00a0CNN Town Hall\u00a0in Columbus, Ohio,\u00a0Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201dClinton\u00a0continued to explain\u00a0that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don\u2019t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.\u201dOhio, a key battleground state,\u00a0was the\u00a0ninth largest coal producing state\u00a0in 2013.\u00a0by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEResponding to an audience question asking what he would do to diminish \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d Trump noted that the United States has been targeted on multiple occasions in the past year by \u201cradical Islamic terrorists. \u201cAnd she,\u201d referring to Clinton, \u201cwon\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t use the term, \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,'\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, to solve the problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name.\u201dIn their coverage of Sunday night\u2019s debate, website Politifact noted that \u201cTrump is right that Clinton and Obama prefer to avoid those words.\u201d While Clinton has, during the course of her campaign for president this year, claimed that she was comfortable saying \u201cradical Islamism\u201d (though not \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d) she has previously refused to use the term because\u00a0\u201cit sounds like we are declaring war against a religion.\u201dPresident Obama has refused to describe jihadist attacks as radical Islamic terrorism\u00a0because\u00a0\u201cterrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL \u2014 They have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse for basically barbarism and death.\u201dA recent Breitbart/Gravis poll\u00a0found that the issue of addressing jihadist attacks as \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d is of particular concerns of Americans of Hispanic descent. 67.7 percent of Hispanic American respondents \u2013 more than any other ethnic group, including White Americans \u2013 in the September 20 poll agreed with the phrase\u00a0\u201cWe must identify Islamic radical terrorism for what it is.

We have no growth in this country. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down to 1 percent. And that\u2019s like no growth. We\u2019re going lower in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\u201cShe,\u201d of course, refers to Hillary Clinton. Trump was speaking in the context of his own plan to lower taxes to spur economic growth, versus Clinton\u2019s plan to raise taxes.Trump said U.S. GDP growth is \u201cdown to 1 percent.\u201d In fact, GDP growth was originally reported as 1.1 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and later revised up to 1.4 percent. Trump\u2019s statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.As for Trump\u2019s assessment of the U.S. as having \u201cjust about the highest\u201d taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying \u201cjust about.\u201d More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he\u2019s talking about. There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates \u2013 America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world \u2013 currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico\u2019s unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.America\u2019s top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.Given the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America\u2019s were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that.by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUE.According to\u00a0the\u00a0the Urban Institute, which examined the\u00a0average Obamacare premium increases from 2015 to 2016, American consumers can expect\u00a0to see major spikes in their healthcare costs.Those people in Oklahoma, who bought their own low-cost exchange insurance plan, have seen their premiums rise\u00a041.8 percent\u00a0from 2015 to 2016.

We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed. While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengageing [sic] the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.The Intercept reports that the memo discussed how to generate positive press for Clinton\u2019s decision making. The site found two articles by Haberman that did the job: here and here.In the first article, Haberman describes touts Clinton\u2019s decision to hire a research team to unearth\u00a0negative items about her \u2014 a process called \u201cself-vetting.\u201d Her insider account bore the title\u00a0\u201cHillary Clinton Begins Process of Vetting \u2014 Herself\u201d:The scope of the firm\u2019s work is unclear. But self-research is considered critical in campaigns. And in the six years since Mrs. Clinton was last a candidate, she has created a paper trail of paid speeches, charitable donations and diplomatic decisions as secretary of state.For months, Democrats not aligned with Mrs. Clinton had privately wondered whether she had started the process of assessing the scope of existing documents, information and other potential material her rivals could use against her. Some expressed concern that she was beginning this self-scrubbing process relatively late, and might not leave herself enough time to learn about her own potential vulnerabilities to be able to respond effectively.In the second article, \u201cHillary Clinton Aides Are in Talks to Fill Top Campaign Roles,\u201d Haberman shows the care and concern Clinton had building her team:The prospects are mostly people who have worked with Mrs. Clinton before, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who asked for anonymity to speak freely about personnel discussions.The conversations reflect a fast-moving effort by Mrs. Clinton to build a campaign as a number of Democratic Party operatives are vying for position. While the budding campaign had been criticized as too white and too male in its early stages, this group of operatives is diverse and would give Mrs. Clinton a number of women and people of color in top jobs.Greenwald and\u00a0Fang wrote that they gave both the Clinton campaign and Haberman 24 hours to contest the veracity of the documents.

Her Attacks on Hillary Clinton Are Not,\u201d says that although there may be truth to Broaddrick\u2019s claims regarding Bill Clinton, \u201cfar less credible, however, is Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her into silence.\u201dGoldberg argues that Broaddrick wrongly interpreted an interaction with Hillary at a fundraiser for Bill\u2019s gubernatorial campaign \u2014 seeing a threat where, in Goldberg\u2019s eyes, there was only typical gladhanding.Broaddrick has given her recollection of this event to Aaron Klein, the Breitbart News editor and reporter who conducted a video interview with her at Washington, DC\u2019s historic Watergate hotel.In an earlier radio interview, Broaddrick said that Clinton delivered\u00a0her line about \u201ceverything you do\u201d for Bill twice and asked if she understood what she was being told:Broaddrick stated that Hillary approached her \u201cand said \u2018It\u2019s so nice to meet you\u2019 and all of the niceties she was trying to say at the time.\u201d\u201cAnd said, \u2018I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him.\u2019 And I just stood there, Aaron. I was sort of you might say shell-shocked.\u201d\u201cAnd she said, \u2018Do you understand. Everything you do.\u2019\u2019\u2019\u201cShe tried to take a hold of my hand and I left. I told the girls I can\u2019t take this. I\u2019m leaving. So I immediately left.\u201dBroaddrick said that \u201cwhat really went through my mind at that time is \u2018She knows. She knew. She\u2019s covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.\u2019\u201dThese details are consistent with a 2000 open letter that Broaddrick wrote during Clinton\u2019s campaign to become U.S. Senator for the state of New York.Goldberg dismisses Broaddrick\u2019s version of events, saying, \u201cBroaddrick interpreted this as a threat, but it sounds like the kind of thing a candidate\u2019s wife at a political event would say to all his supporters. Even in her rendering of Hillary\u2019s words, there is nothing outwardly sinister in them.\u201dGoldberg then declares the question of Hillary\u2019s intimidation asked and answered.\u00a0\u201cWhen you examine every accusation of Hillary as an \u2018attacker\u2019 of women, it ends up looking equally flimsy,\u201d she writes. Her evidence? The aforementioned anecdote from Broaddrick and a private note where Clinton called Monica Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic loony tune.\u201dUnmentioned by Goldberg:\u2022Kathleen Willey\u2019s allegation that she was harassed and intimidated before testifying during Paula Jones\u2019 sexual assault lawsuit against Bill.\n\u2022A San Francisco talk show host\u2019s claim that notorious private detective Jack Palladino copped to involvement in this alleged intimidation campaign (the Washington Post first reported that the Clintons hired Palladino to handle \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d in 1992).\n\u2022Vanity Fair reporting that Clinton said of Gennifer Flowers: \u201cI would crucify her\u201d in court \u2014 though she was telling the truth and Bill did admit, years later, to an affair with Flowers.Goldberg then concludes with\u00a0a wish for Hillary to perform well in Sunday night\u2019s presidential debate. \u201cBill Clinton\u2019s history with women is hard to defend,\u201d she\u00a0writes. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s history is not.

(AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton took nearly every precaution to ensure voters would never know what she told investment bankers, lobbyists and corporate executives in dozens of closed-door paid speeches before running for president.Turns out, the Democratic presidential nominee had good reason to do so.The private comments strike a tone starkly at odds with the fiery message she\u2019s pushed throughout her campaign, particularly during the hard-fought Democratic primary. Some of her remarks give fresh fuel to liberals\u2019 worst fears about Clinton, namely that she is a political moderate, happy to cut backroom deals with corporate interests and curry favor with Wall Street for campaign dollars.The WikiLeaks organization on Friday posted what it said were thousands of emails obtained in a hack of the Clinton campaign chairman\u2019s personal email account. Among the documents posted online was an internal review of the speeches conducted by campaign aides to survey the political damage her remarks could cause if they ever became public.In what aides calculated were the most damaging passages, she reflects on the necessity of \u201cunsavory\u201d political dealing, telling real estate investors that \u201cyou need both a public and private position.\u201d To investment bankers from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, Clinton admits that she\u2019s \u201ckind of far removed\u201d from the middle-class upbringing that she frequently touts on the campaign trail. She tells Xerox CEO Ursula Burns that both political parties should be \u201csensible, moderate, pragmatic.\u201dAnd in speeches to some of the country\u2019s biggest banks, she highlighted her long ties to Wall Street, bantering with top executives and saying that she views the financial industry as a partner in government regulation.\u201cPart of the problem with the political situation, too, is that there is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives,\u201d she said, according to an excerpt from an October 2013 discussion with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.Clinton appears to question the importance of the divestment of assets that financial executives often undertake to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest when they enter government service.\u201cYou know, the divestment of assets, the stripping of all kinds of positions, the sale of stocks. It just becomes very onerous and unnecessary,\u201d she said.Clinton\u2019s campaign has refused to confirm \u2014 or deny \u2014 the authenticity of the thousands of emails, suggesting they were part of a Russian effort to influence the outcome of the presidential race. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,\u201d campaign chairman John Podesta tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.\u201dIn an effort to keep those speeches private, strongly worded contracts prohibited unauthorized recordings, reporters were banned and, in some cases, blog posts about her remarks pulled off websites. Throughout her campaign, she has staunchly refused to release transcripts, resisting pressure from primary rival Bernie Sanders and the media to do so.The WikiLeaks disclosures should be the kind of \u201cOctober surprise\u201d that would thrill Clinton\u2019s opponents, who\u2019ve spent years attacking her as untrustworthy and willing to say anything for personal gain.Yet Republicans have found themselves largely unable to capitalize on the moment, consumed instead by the latest scandal of their nominee, a video showing Trump admitting to making predatory and lewd advances on women.This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has saved Clinton from damaging political fallout. The memory of Clinton staggering and stumbling after leaving a 9/11 memorial event last month was largely erased by Trump\u2019s destructive performance in the first presidential debate.But Clinton\u2019s private comments, now public, aren\u2019t going away. If she wins the White House, they\u2019ll trail her into the Oval Office, planting seeds of distrust among some of her liberal allies.A January 2016 email from the Clinton campaign\u2019s research director to top communications staffers includes excerpts from 15 of the more than 100 speeches she gave after leaving the State Department, appearances that netted her $21.7 million.One passage puts Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has struggled with repeatedly during the 2016 election. During the first general election debate, Clinton said she supports \u201csmart and fair trade.\u201dBut nearly three years earlier, in a talk to a Brazilian bank, she said her \u201cdream\u201d is \u201ca hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders\u201d and asked her audience to think of what doubling American trade with Latin America \u201cwould mean for everybody in this room.\u201dIn another speech that year, Clinton conceded that presidential candidates need the financial backing of Wall Street to mount a competitive national campaign. That\u2019s a position that plays right into political attacks leveled by both Sanders and Trump, who\u2019ve accused Clinton of being bought and paid for by Wall Street.\u201cNew York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle,\u201d she said at the October 2013 investor conference, sponsored by Goldman Sachs. \u201cThere are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy.\u201dThree years after her speech, her campaign and pro-Clinton super PACs have raised nearly $59 million from financial investors, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics.___Follow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Associated Press, Bernie Sanders, John Podesta, Lisa Lerer, Open Borders, wall street, WikiLeaksComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

McCabe9 Oct 2016Washington, D.C.0Raddatz, Breitbart News has learned, refused to publish a story on the alleged improper collusion and coordination between then Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) and the national headquarters of the\u00a0Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, also known as ACORN\u2014despite having enough evidence to do so.Raddatz, along with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, will co-moderate this upcoming Sunday evening\u2019s presidential debate between GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton.After she and her producer received a tip about ACORN corruption\u2014and Obama\u2019s connection to it\u2014and evidence backing up the eventual whistleblower\u2019s claims, they showed initial interest in pursuing the story. Anita Moncrief, the eventual ACORN whistleblower told Breitbart News exclusively that she met with Raddatz\u2019s producer Avni Patel in 2008.Both Patel and Raddatz were given documents that they covered up and refused to report on until after the election. Raddatz, who was then the White House correspondent for ABC News, and her producer Patel were also provided with personal accounts of the collusion between ACORN and the Obama campaign in October 2008, Moncrief told Breitbart News.Moncrief, who worked in ACORN\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters, would later expose the organization when she turned into a full-blown whistleblower after the election. But if Raddatz ran the story, the election may have turned out differently, especially had the public known the depths to which this scandal went.Moncrief told Breitbart News that she met with Raddatz\u2019s producer Patel in Washington after initially having made contact with Raddatz herself through a representative. The meeting lasted almost an hour in a coffee shop in Washington, D.C.After meeting with Patel, Moncrief received an email from the producer:Anita,\nIt was good talking to you today. I look forward to learning more, and\u00a0taking a look at those documents you mentioned. It sounds like the\u00a0easiest way to get those from you would be to directly download the\u00a0files from your web-transfer site. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can try\u00a0to\u00a0send them to my gmail account.Patel gave Moncrief every indication that ABC News was going to broadcast the report, she said.\u201cThey were very excited. They said they were willing to run the story,\u201d she said.Using the user name and password given to her by Patel, Moncrief sent documents on Oct. 14, 2008 to Patel using the company\u2019s file transfer protocol line, ftp1.abc.com.\u00a0There was another transfer of another dozen documents by email to Patel on Oct. 26, 2008.Moncrief told Breitbart News that ABC News received and acknowledged receipt of the documents that spelled out specific instances of collusion between the Obama campaign and named individuals at ACORN and Project Vote.\u00a0Among the documents were internal correspondences with Moncrief\u2019s name, which she said she included to prove that she was who she said she was.Moncrief told Breitbart News the Obama campaign passed to ACORN and by extension to its sister entity Project Vote the campaign\u2019s full donor list, which included all donors and fuller descriptions. This list was different from the limited list of contributors the campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission, which for example did not include small-dollar donors.\u00a0Because of their non-profit status, ACORN and Project Vote were prohibited from coordinating with a candidate\u2019s committee.ACORN and Project Vote also received the full donor lists from the 2004 presidential campaign of then Sen. John F. Kerry (D-MA), she said.Soon after Moncrief left ACORN, she contacted the New York Times and its reporter Stephanie Strom about the cooperation she witnessed. Strom and Moncrief worked together from July 2008 to October 2008.But, by September, Moncrief said she was frustrated with Strom\u2019s articles that were based on her information about ACORN and Project Vote, but failed to describe the cooperation.\u00a0Moncrief said Strom told her that her editors were watering down the stories after they were submitted.Attorney and columnist Michael Gaynor\u00a0told Breitbart News that over the summer of 2008, he became an adviser to Moncrief and her effort to expose ACORN-Obama corruption.In September 2008, Moncrief told him that she was beginning to think that the Times was just stringing her along, he said. \u201c\u2018I need a Plan B\u2019 she told me.\u201dGaynor calls himself a conservative Catholic and he said he immediately suggested EWTV, radio host Laura Ingraham and Fox News.The problem was that Moncrief was a left-wing activist and she wanted to go through a left-leaning media outlet, so he suggested ABC News and Martha Raddatz, he said.Gaynor said he met Raddatz through email because he she sent him proof that he had repeated a false claim about her suppressing the number of soldiers in Iraq supporting Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) for president.With that awkwardness between them, Gaynor said he reached out to Raddatz and explained to her the whole story of collusion between ACORN and Project Vote and the Obama campaign. After the initial conversation, Raddatz told Gaynor that she was interested.\u00a0Moncrief said she then emailed Raddatz and attached her resume, so that Raddatz would appreciate her background. Raddatz emailed back and told her that Patel would would follow up.Raddatz has a troubled history of undisclosed associations with Democrats that arguably affect her ability to be impartial.She\u00a0was the moderator for the 2012 vice presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and now House Speaker\u2014then GOP vice presidential nominee\u2014Paul Ryan. But Raddatz did not disclose to viewers that Biden\u2019s running mate, President Barack Obama, attended her 1991 wedding\u2014when she married now former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Julius Genachowski.The position of FCC chairman is a presidentially-appointed slot, which means Obama,\u00a0after attending her wedding to Genachowski,\u00a0appointed her by-then ex-husband to one of the most senior positions in the federal government. Raddatz and Genachowski divorced in 1997.\u00a0Genachowski, a long-time friend of the president\u2019s, also attended Obama\u2019s 1992 wedding,\u00a0when he married First Lady Michelle Obama.At a public event in 2013, after Obama and Biden won reelection, Breitbart News confronted Raddatz about her failure to disclose the significant conflict of interest to the general public before moderating that debate.At the National Press Club event, Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle asked Raddatz:\u201cDo you think\u2014there was obviously a little bit of a kerfuffle ahead of the vice presidential debate about the fact that the president attended your wedding to the FCC chairman. Do you think that that was handled right and given a second chance would you have done it a little differently?\u201dRaddatz responded:\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. I mean, I didn\u2019t have to handle that. It was\u2014and I\u2019m really not going to comment about that. That was something that happened two days before the debate. It had been in The New York Times quite a while before that, I believe. I just got to put this out of my head. That had nothing to do with what I did at the debate. Nothing.\u201dThis revelation about ABC News covering up the ACORN story before the 2008 election is also not the first time that network\u2014which is influenced heavily by former Bill Clinton White House staffer and ABC This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2014covered up a damning story about a Democrat right before an election.In fact, right before the 2012 election, ABC News among other outlets had been provided with intricate details about the scandal that has since, years later, led to the indictment of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ). They had a chance to break part of the scandal, and chose to not print allegations from prostitutes in the Dominican Republic that Menendez had underpaid them for sex.They also had evidence of other parts of the Menendez scandal, particularly connections to Democratic Party mega-donor Dr. Salomon Melgen\u2014who\u2019s also been indicted on the corruption charges\u2014that the network decided against running.When Raddatz had Menendez on her program after the election with the scandal dominating national news,\u00a0she conveniently forgot to ask him about it, as Breitbart News reported at the time.Shortly thereafter, ABC News attempted to undermine the accounts of several of the prostitutes\u2014but after Menendez was indicted, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed the prostitution allegations against Menendez were in fact supported by \u201ccorroborating evidence.\u201dEven BuzzFeed News admitted\u00a0Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle\u2014who originally reported the prostitution story while at The Daily Caller\u2014was correct on the story.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Acorn, barack obama, Bob Menendez, debate, Donald Trump, FCC, martha raddatzComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak9 Oct 20160The Democratic presidential nominee is exploiting\u00a0a video from 2005 that surfaced Friday, showing her Republican rival, Donald Trump, joking about groping women.Trump, while apologizing, has pointed to Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior towards women in the Oval Office and throughout his career \u2014 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in enabling it.Though Trump is not running against Bill, his defenders have focused on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s treatment of\u00a0the many women who accused her husband of impropriety and even assault \u2014 including Monica Lewinsky, Juanita Broaddrick, and others.The\u00a0Washington Post recently recalled the pattern of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defenses of her husband against what she called \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d:\u2026 Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers \u201csome failed cabaret singer who doesn\u2019t even have much of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to fall back on.\u201d She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, \u201cI mean, I would crucify her.\u201dThe\u00a0Post\u00a0noted: \u201cSix years later, Bill Clinton acknowledged a sexual encounter with Flowers.\u201dIt added that when the Lewinsky scandal emerged, in which Clinton had oral sex with the then-White House intern in the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton refused to credit the story of his accuser, choosing to believe her husband\u2019s lies instead. She reportedly called Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic loony toon.\u201dFormer Bill Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos, now an anchor for ABC News, wrote in his memoir All Too Human: A Political Education\u00a0that Hillary Clinton had to \u201csavage her enemies\u201d during the Lewinsky affair, repeating a pattern from previous scandals involving her husband\u2019s behavior towards women.In 1991, for example, when a woman named Connie Hamzy emerged to accuse Bill Clinton of having an affair with her, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cWe have to destroy her story,\u201d according to Stephanopoulos. He then set about arranging affidavits from people who could back up Bill Clinton\u2019s story: \u201cWe\u2019d survived our first bimbo eruption,\u201d Stephanopoulos recalled.Later, Stephanopoulos wrote, he wondered whether he had been \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior \u201cbecause my defense of Clinton against past bimbo eruptions had been predicated on my belief that he wouldn\u2019t create new ones.\u201dThe same might be said of Hillary Clinton.Joel B.

Some 47,000 Americans died from overdoses, mostly from heroin and other opiates, in just a single year, 2014.\u201cThe open border policies of Hillary Clinton, including catch and release, another terrible practice, have allowed a massive influx of drugs into New Hampshire, and frankly, to states all over our country. Almost every state. And it\u2019s really fueled the tremendous drug and heroin crisis that we have,\u201d Trump said.We\u2019re going to close up those borders, folks. Believe me. And I promise that to you in New Hampshire, more than anything else\u2014I said, I talk about it no matter where I go and I mention this state, because it was really the first glimpse I got at how serious a problem we have. They\u2019re poisoning our youth. They\u2019re poisoning more than our youth\u2014they\u2019re poisoning everybody. But they\u2019re poisoning our youth. It\u2019s tough enough out there. Our youth doesn\u2019t have a chance with what\u2019s happening, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore.\u201cWe\u2019re going to help the people that are so badly addicted,\u201d he added to applause. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help them\u2026 I\u2019m going to stop the drugs from coming in.\u201dNearly all of the heroin consumed in the U.S. comes from Mexico and is brought across the border by Mexican traffickers, the Washington Post reported before Trump\u2019s presidential run.While answering a question during the town hall, Trump repeated that he would stop the flow of deadly drugs pouring into the country. He said he had asked border patrol and ICE agents, \u201cHow important is the wall?\u201d\u201cThey said, \u2018Mr. Trump, it is absolutely necessary for us to do our proper job,'\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhich gave me a little additional security as far as the wall is concerned.\u201d\u201cWe need the wall. We have to stop the drugs\u2014heroin\u2014but many drugs. We have to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Believe me, it is poisoning our country. It\u2019s poisoning our youth. And we\u2019re going to stop it, and stop it fast, long before the wall gets up,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start that wall fast. I get \u2019em built fast. But I\u2019ll tell you, long before, we\u2019re going to stop that poison from flowing into our country.\u201d The audience applauded.While media outlets shut down their comments section so readers can\u2019t talk back, they can still receive massive blowback on Twitter.

Williams, Ph.D.7 Oct 20160In his article titled \u201cPope Francis\u2019 LGBT failure,\u201d Salon writer Nico Lang compares the Pope\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d against the gender ideology to those of \u201cthe right-wing extremists who have sought to prevent trans people from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity.\u201dThe Cool Pope is \u201cnot so cool after all,\u201d Lang quipped, just before comparing the Catholic Church to the Republican Party\u2014apparently the meanest slur he could come up with.The gender ideology claims that governments should require individuals to accept the \u201cgender identity\u201d of men or women who seek to live as members of the opposite sex. For example, new federal rules now urge punishment for K-12 students who refuse to use the female pronoun \u2013\u2018her\u201d \u2014 when referring a male classmate who dresses like a girl, or who do not want to share a bathroom with members of the opposite sex.Lang notes that this past weekend, Francis referred to teaching gender theory in schools as \u201cideological colonization.\u201dDuring his short\u00a0trip to the Caucasus, Pope Francis also called gender theory a \u201cgreat enemy\u201d of marriage, adding that the ideology of gender is part of a global war of ideas out to destroy traditional marriage.In an extended, off-the-cuff speech in Georgia, Francis said that today we are witnessing a \u201cglobal war to destroy marriage\u201d in which\u00a0gender theory\u00a0places a key role, fighting \u201cnot with weapons, but with ideas.\u201dBut although the Pope\u2019s stern opposition to gender theory may strike Nico Lang as a novelty, in point of fact, it is nothing new.For years the Pope has been an outspoken critic of LGBT agitators\u2019 efforts to impose same-sex marriage on society along with theories of gender fluidity that divorce gender from biological sexual differences.In March, Francis published an extensive\u00a0teaching\u00a0letter\u00a0on marriage and the family called\u00a0The Joy of Love\u00a0(Amoris Laetitia), in which he underscored the unique roles of motherhood and fatherhood, and called same-sex marriage legislation the \u201clegal deconstruction of the family.\u201dIn that same text, Francis slammed gender theory for its denial of \u201cthe difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman,\u201d and for its dream of \u201ca society without sexual differences.\u201d\u201cAn appreciation of our body as male or female,\u201d he said, is \u201cnecessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves.\u201d Efforts to erase sexual differences based in biology are a symptom of a sick society that \u201cno longer knows how to deal with it,\u201d he wrote.In the past, Francis has used even stronger language to denounce gender theory. In early 2014, the Pope called modern gender ideology \u201cdemonic,\u201d and compared the teaching of gender theory to children with the educational policies of\u00a0Hitler.In his Salon article, Lang declares that the pope\u2019s message on transgender \u201cboils down the old canard that the Catholic Church has been using against gays and lesbians for decades: \u2018Love the sinner, hate the sin.\u2019\u201dThe Pope\u2019s ideas are \u201cbiblically inaccurate\u201d and outdated, Lang insists.If loving sinners and hating sin is a \u201ccanard,\u201d at least the Pope has Jesus on his side\u2014even if Salon is no longer a fan.Follow Thomas D.

Still, hiring at that level is enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. Economists have expected the pace to slow as the supply of unemployed workers declines.The hiring figures could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise the short-term interest rate it controls by December. After seven years of pinning that rate at a record low near zero to try to spur more borrowing and spending, the Fed raised its rate in December. It has not acted since.But the Fed signaled after its policy meeting last month that it would likely act in the coming months. The Fed will meet in November, just before the election, but analysts expect it to hold off until the campaign ends.Recent data suggest that the economy is picking up after a weak start to the year, though growth is unlikely to accelerate very much.Consumer spending was flat in August, the weakest showing in five months. And factories have struggled as businesses have put off investing in new machinery, computers and other equipment.Still, a recent private survey found that manufacturing expanded in September after shrinking in August. Orders for factory goods jumped, suggesting that output may rise further.Consumers also appear increasingly confident about the economy, which could stimulate a rebound in spending. Consumer confidence reached a nine-year high last month.Retailers are expecting robust spending for the holiday shopping season. The National Retail Federation projects that holiday spending will rise 3.6 percent this year from last year. That\u2019s better than last year\u2019s gain and slightly above the 3.4 percent average since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009.The economy expanded at just a tepid 1.1 percent annual pace in the first six months of the year. Still, economists have forecast that growth accelerated to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annualized pace in the July-September quarter.The slower growth hasn\u2019t led employers to cut back on staffing. Applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, fell on average last month to a 43-year low.Big Government, Big Journalism, Economics, Federal Reserve, Jobs Numbers, unemploymentComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Trump was a single man at the time.Of course, Trump\u2019s real crime is that he is the 2016 Republican nominee for president.Check out the salacious details CNN lays out:In that video \u2014 a 1994 VHS tape obtained by CNN titled \u201cPlayboy Centerfold\u201d \u2014 Trump takes part in Playboy magazine\u2019s search for its 40th anniversary Playmate.The scenes featuring Trump do not contain nudity or sexually explicit content, but other scenes in the movie depict fully nude women seductively rubbing themselves in different scenarios.In one scene, Trump interviews a potential model, asking her what qualities she possesses that would make her the right choice for the 40th anniversary cover.\u201cI believe that it\u2019s not just beauty, I think it\u2019s an attitude,\u201d the model says. \u201cI think it has a lot to do with personality and an attitude. I think Playboy really represents that, and I believe that I have that, and I have what it takes to represent them.\u201d\u201cWell I think you have what it takes too,\u201d Trump replies. \u201cAnd I think everyone in this room thinks you have what it takes also.\u201dAnything else, CNN?How about what else was going on a four-hour drive south in 1994?How about Paula Jones coming forward in 1994 to accuse Clinton of sexually propositioning her while she was an Arkansas state employee and he was governor.There were more scandals in those years of the Clinton administration, but none of them brought the nation to a halt like the the president\u2019s two-year affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.It was the relationship with Lewinsky that led to Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment and it was that relationship that forever stained the Oval Office, the president\u2019s study, the hallway between the Oval Office and the study and the restroom adjacent to the Oval Office.Seems a bigger deal that a few Polaroids.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Cable News Network, Donald J.

Pollak7 Oct 20160Olivia Nuzzi of the Daily Beast, for example, wrote that \u201cat some point in the last quarter century, Klein lost his goddamn mind,\u201d and that \u201che just makes shit up, and it\u2019s not even good.\u201d She cannot prove anything in the book is made up, of course \u2014 she simply chooses to believe\u00a0that it is.Klein has been a journalist for nearly six decades\u2014seven of those years as foreign editor of Newsweek, ten years as the editor in chief of the New York Times Magazine (during which time the magazine won the first Pulitzer Prize in its history), and twenty-seven years as a contributing editor of Vanity Fair. Hence the nastiness with which his books about the Clintons, including the latest, are greeted by the media: he is an apostate of journalism\u2019s left-wing political faith, and must be punished.The media that otherwise applauds the\u00a0fanciful behind-the-scenes drama in supposed tell-all books like Game Change, which ridiculed Sarah Palin and was turned into an HBO movie in time for the 2012 elections, dismisses\u00a0Klein\u2019s reporting on Hillary Clinton.But Klein\u2019s books about Hillary have featured exclusive interviews and news-breaking stories that other journalists have found hard to match. In\u00a0many cases, these interviews and stories have proven to be illuminating \u2014 and often prescient.In The Truth About Hillary (2005),\u00a0Klein was the first journalist to prove that Hillary knew about Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky long before it became public, and that when the story broke she tried to pretend she was shocked.\u00a0He also\u00a0documented the original source of Hillary\u2019s radical politics, the Reverend Don Jones, Hillary\u2019s youth minister, who gave Hillary a subscription to motive, a leftwing publication that favored Cuba, socialism, and the Black Panthers. She would go on to write her senior thesis at Wellesley about radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, corresponding with Alinsky himself.In\u00a0The Amateur (2012),\u00a0Klein unmasked Valerie Jarrett\u2019s shadow presidency and her infighting with Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. He also\u00a0revealed Obama\u2019s rift with\u00a0Oprah Winfrey, who declined\u00a0to campaign for Obama in 2012. The book came out in May; the New York Daily News reported on September 3 \u2014 nearly three months later \u2014 that Oprah would skip the Democratic National Convention. Later, in August, Klein\u00a0reported\u00a0that Obama offered the 2012 vice presidential spot to Clinton, a story that was confirmed a year later by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann\u00a0in their book Double Down.In\u00a0Blood Feud\u00a0(2014),\u00a0Klein was the first journalist to report on the jealousy and antipathy that divide the Obamas and the Clintons. The hatred between the Clintons and Obamas was substantiated two years later, on September 16, 2016, when Colin Powell\u2019s emails were leaked to the public. Klein also reported, correctly,\u00a0that Hillary knew from the beginning that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was carried out by an affiliate of al Qaeda. And he\u00a0was the first journalist to uncover the true story of Hillary\u2019s fainting spell and concussion while she was secretary of state, anticipating new doubts about her health.Nuzzi calls Klein\u2019s books \u201cnarrative fiction,\u201d which\u00a0better describes Hillary Clinton\u2019s stories about herself.\u00a0Clinton\u2019s more egregious biographical whoppers \u2014 the Tuzla dash, for example \u2014 are largely buried and forgotten, while the media spends months lending undue credibility to her\u00a0lies about a YouTube video in Benghazi, or about never sending classified material on her private email server, before finally admitting the truth and then promptly ignoring it, once she is past the worst danger.Klein relies heavily on unnamed sources, and dialogue that is reconstructed second- or even third-hand. That is fair game for criticism, as is his writing style, which tends toward the dramatic. And every journalist is bound to make a mistake or two.But many journalists, including Halperin and Heinemann of\u00a0Game Change renown,\u00a0use information from anonymous sources to tell important stories that otherwise would go unreported.\u00a0Why are their stories about Sarah Palin widely believed, while Klein\u2019s stories about Hillary Clinton are treated as toxic until proven true?The answer is too obvious to require explanation.Joel B.

She has now hired an unspecified number of former Secret Service agents as part of the effort to \u201c[amp] up her security to Presidential levels.\u201d The security detail will reportedly include \u201cone team of 2 hired muscles (minimum) everywhere she goes\u201d and the car in which she travels will be \u201carmored.\u201dThe move comes after the 35-year-old Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was robbed at gunpoint by masked men in her Paris hotel room during Paris Fashion Week. The thieves \u2014 who remain at large \u2014 reportedly stole $5.6 million worth of jewelry, including a diamond ring given to Kardashian by her husband Kanye West said to be worth $4 million.AFP reported that Kardashian was \u201cbadly shaken but physically unharmed\u201d after the incident, during which she was reportedly bound and gagged.It is noteworthy to contrast Kardashian\u2019s approach to her personal security with her campaign for more gun control for law-abiding citizens; the former relies on good guys with guns to keep her safe, while the latter makes it harder for good guys to get guns to keep themselves safe.After\u00a0the June 17, 2015, firearm-based attack on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Kardashian voiced support\u00a0for\u00a0\u201cstricter legislation to prevent mass shootings.\u201d The\u00a0Daily Mail quoted her saying, \u201cI\u2019m not the type to have them (guns) in my house, they scare me so much,\u201d yet she did not hesitate to push for increased gun control measures as something she believed would \u201cchange the world.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really a gun person, and we do not have strict enough gun control laws,\u201d she reportedly said.Kardashian appeared to have\u00a0missed the fact that gun laws in Paris are among the most strict\u00a0in the world, but this did not prevent terrorists from acquiring guns and killing 12 people in the January 7, 2015 attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Moreover, on November 13, 2015 \u2014 months after Kardashian described gun control as something that could \u201cchange the world\u201d \u2014 armed terrorists shot and killed 130 people in gun-controlled Paris.On June 12, the day an attacker shot and killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Kardashian suggested the US needs stronger laws to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists.\u00a0 She tweeted:\u00a0\u201cUnder current federal law people on terror watch lists can legally buy guns \u2013 this is called the Terror Gap.\u201d But Kardashian apparently missed the fact that the Orlando attacker was not on a terror watch list; therefore, including the terror watch list in background checks would not have hindered, much less prevented, the Orlando attack.As recently as August 5, 2016, Kardashian and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe\u00a0met with family members of gun violence victims at an event organized\u00a0by the Michael Bloomberg-funded Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety. Two months later, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint while in Paris, a city with gun control that exceeds the laws\u00a0Kardashian has advocated for in the United States.Kardashian will apparently\u00a0surround herself with more good guys with guns for safety, but has not recanted her efforts to make it harder for good guys to acquire guns with which to defend themselves.\u00a0AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Clinton says she respects Trump\u2019s children and they say a lot about Donald. Trump says he considers Clinton\u2019s comments about his children to be a nice compliment. Trump says Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t quit\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t give up.\u201d \u201cI tell it like it is,\u201d Trump says.

He says Clinton made millions because of the power of her office and wonders why she isn\u2019t putting any of her money into the campaign\u2026 Trump says he is not beholden to special interests like Clinton.Scene in the spin room right now \u2014 reporters waiting to see who will enter pic.twitter.com/ww5s4f1VIe\u2014 MaryAlice Parks (@maryaliceparks) October 10, 201610:24: Raddatz keeps interrupting Trump and says \u201cwe have to get the audience\u201d after she monopolized parts of the debate.10:21: Cooper asks about Trump about \u201cdiscipline\u201d and his early morning Tweets about a former Miss Universe\u2019s alleged sex tape. Trump says \u201cTweeting happens to be a modern-day form of communication.\u201d He says it\u2019s a \u201cvery effective way of communication.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not un-proud of it,\u201d he says.When asked if Trump has the discipline to be president, Clinton says, \u201cno.\u201d She says it\u2019s in part because \u201cthose of who have had the great privilege to see this job up close and know how difficult it is.\u201d10:20: Raddatz again giving people distrustful of the mainstream press every reason to\u00a0continue to do so.Why is Raddatz debating trump?Isnt that hillarys job?\u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) October 10, 201610:18: Cooper presses Clinton on her \u201cdeplorables\u201d comment. He asks how can Clinton unite a country if she has written off tens of millions of Americans. Clinton says her argument is not with his supporters but with Trump and his \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cdivisive comments.\u201d She claims Trump \u201cincites violence\u201d at rallies. No mention of left-wing agitators who attacked Trump supporters in places like Chicago and Northern California.Trump on Clinton: \"Believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. When she said 'deplorables,' she meant it\" https://t.co/ItN1OKNjif\u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 10, 201610:14:\u00a0Trump, in response to questioner, who asks about whether the candidates can be a devoted president for all Americans.. says Clinton\u00a0has called Americans \u201cdeplorables\u201d and he will be a president for \u201call Americans.\u201d He says he will be the president for \u201call of the people.\u201d Trump talks about the inner cities and says politicians talk about helping African-Americans and Hispanics in the inner cities and they do \u00a0nothing about it. Clinton lists her accomplishments with the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and helping underserved communities in the South. Clinton again brings up the so-called Trump Effect (the study was unscientific).10:13: Trump points out that when Clinton goes a minute over her allowed time, nobody interrupts. He says the moderators interrupt the second he goes over his time.10:12: Clinton says it\u2019s not \u201csmart strategy\u201d for American forces to be occupying Syria. She says Trump claims he knows more about ISIS than the generals. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t\u201d she says.10:07: Trump says almost everything Clinton has done in foreign policy has been a \u201cmistake\u201d and \u201cdisaster.\u201d Trump says Clinton made Iran powerful with possibly \u201cthe dumbest deal I have ever seen.\u201d Trump says Iran and Russia are now against us. Trump now says Clinton doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. He says he doesn\u2019t know Assad but at least he\u2019s killing ISIS. Raddatz keeps trying to make Trump bad by acting like a know-it-all college professor who knows more than the candidate (this is why the public hates the mainstream press). It seems like Trump is debating Raddatz instead of Clinton.\u00a0\"He and I haven't spoken and I disagree,\" says @realDonaldTrump of @mike_pence on possible Syria intervention. @MarthaRaddatz everyone.\u2014 Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) October 10, 201610:06:Hillary's got the fly vote https://t.co/CO3sSbsUIK\u2014 Best Vines (@TheFunnyVine) October 10, 2016My first time on live television. #HilaryClintonFly pic.twitter.com/KaFOw2an0j\u2014 Hilary Clinton Fly (@fly_hilary) October 10, 201610:05: Clinton is asked about Syria. Online questioner makes comparison\u00a0to the Holocaust. Clinton says there is a determined effort by the Russians to destroy \u201cAleppo\u201d to get rid of the last of the rebels against Assad. She says she has advocated no-fly and safe zones.10:03: Is this debate about the moderators or the actual supposedly \u201cundecided\u201d voters? There doesn\u2019t seem to be that much engagement with the actual voters in the room.9:58: Cooper grills Trump on taxes. He says he used deductions in the tax code that people like Clinton allowed. She says Clinton has wealthy friends who want to keep the carried interest provisions in place. Trump says he pays tax and federal income tax. Trump says Clinton is \u201call talk and no action.\u201d He keeps bringing up Sanders\u2019s quote about Clinton\u2019s \u201cbad judgment.\u201d He now slams Clinton for creating the vacuum in the Middle East that allowed ISIS to form. \u201cCongratulations, great job,\u201d Trump says. Clinton says she has been in favor of getting rid of carried interests. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do it?\u201d Trump asks. Clinton says because she was a Senator with a Republican President. \u201cUnder our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power,\u201d Clinton shoots back.9:55: Clinton says Trump lives in an \u201calternative reality\u201d and \u201ceverything Trump has said is not true.\u201d Clinton implies Trump may not have paid taxes for 20 years and she says \u201cDonald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald.\u201d She accuses Trump of wanting to help the rich with his tax plan. It seems like Clinton doesn\u2019t know anything about Trump\u2019s tax plan and is just repeating typical Dem. talking points about Republicans on taxes. Clinton wants the Buffet rule and a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. She claims she wants to invest in hard-working families.9:54: Trump says Clinton has been there for 30 years and the system has never changed and will never change under Clinton.[Trump should use this opportunity to frame this election as one between an outsider versus consummate insider but he just is not adept at framing the race in ways he should.[9:53: Questioner asks what he would change in the tax code to ensure that the wealthy \u201cpay their fair share.\u201d Trump says he would \u201cknock out the tax code\u201d and get rid of the \u201ccarried interest provision.\u201d[These are \u201cundecided\u201d voters?]9:51: \u201cHonest Abe never lied,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.\u201d He says Clinton got caught lying after the Wikileaks dump and is now blaming Lincoln for her lies. Trump says he has no loans from Russia and doesn\u2019t know anything about the country\u2019s inner workings. He points out that the U.S. government has seen his balance sheet and chose him to do the Old Post Office building. After Clinton calls on Trump to release his taxes, Trump says \u00a0people like Warren Buffet and George Soros took \u201cmassive deductions.\u201d He says he would be \u201cvery proud\u201d to release his taxes after his routine audit is done.9:48: Clinton now claims that her comments about private/public positions was in reference to Lincoln. [What spin!] She now says Russians are engaged in hacking to get Trump elected and talks up Trump\u2019s praise of Putin. Moderators let Clinton talk, talk, talk off-topic again before Raddatz FINALLY interrupts for one of the first times.I'm told the women Trump invited to the debate are set to appear in the post-debate spin room, per campaign aide. #debate\u2014 Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 10, 20169:45: Clinton claims that terrorist recruiters are using Trump\u2019s words to recruit more terrorists. Trump points out that Clinton went 25 seconds over her time and the moderators didn\u2019t interrupt. Trump points out that Clinton, when she was Secretary of State, didn\u2019t force countries to accept illegal immigrants who committed crimes like murder. Trump says drugs are pouring through our Southern border \u201cat a record clip\u201d and Clinton doesn\u2019t understand the border and wants amnesty. Trump says Clinton\u2019s judgment is so bad that she should never be president.[Now would be a good time for Trump to point out Clinton\u2019s wikileaks emails about open borders and her need for public/private positions. Raddatz transitions to the question from a voter about whether it is okay for a politician to be two-faced.]9:43: Raddatz helps Clinton even in her questioning, saying \u201cwe know you want tougher vetting.\u201d Again, the moderators are like rasslin\u2019 announcers doing their best to make Clinton get \u201cover\u201d with the audience while trying to turn Trump into the \u201cheel\u201d that that audience hates. Is Trump skilled enough to be the anti-hero and heel that rasslin\u2019 crowds started to love in the Attitude Era like Stone Cold Steve Austin?9:41: Clinton says \u201cwe are not at war with Islam.\u201d \u00a0She says she wants a country where citizens like you are welcome just like everyone else. Raddatz piles on, again pressing Trump on his Muslim ban. She asks if Trump supports the Muslim ban. Trump says if he had been president, Captain Kahn would have been alive today because he would not have gone into Iraq like Clinton. He calls him an \u201cAmerican hero.\u201d Raddatz keeps grilling Trump. The moderators have hardly interrogated Clinton tonight. Trump keeps trying to explain his \u201cextreme vetting\u201d program and says Clinton wants more Syrian refugees. \u201cThe great Trojan Horse of all time,\u201d he says. Trump says he doesn\u2019t want hundreds of thousands of people from Syria coming in when we don\u2019t know nothing about their values or their love for our country.\u00a09:39: Clinton thanks the questioner for asking the question. She says there have been \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d things said about Muslims. She brings up Trump\u2019s attacks on the Kahn family. Clinton talks about the country\u2019s famous Muslims and says we just lost one in Muhammad Ali. Clinton says it\u2019s short-sighted and \u201cdangerous\u201d for Trump to be engaged in demagogic comments about Muslims.[These are \u201cUNDECIDED\u201d voters?]9:37: Muslim questioner asks Trump about Islamophobia. \u201cYou\u2019re right about islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Trump says, again showing that he wants to appease whomever is speaking to him. But he says we have to get Muslims to report what they see in their communities. Trump now says Clinton and Obama won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and \u201cbefore you solve it, you have to say the name.\u201d9:36: Cooper grills Trump on specifics re: Obamacare/health \u00a0(he wants to know how he would get insurance companies to insure uninsured people without a mandate) care while Hillary Clinton smirks as Trump is under fire.9:32: Trump says Obamacare is a disaster and is only getting worse. He says Obamacare is expensive for those who have it and unbelievably expensive for the country. He says we have to replace it with something that is less expensive and words. He again talks about getting rid of the lines around the states. He says Clinton wants a single-payer plan like Canada and has been after this for years. He says Obamacare is just the first step.[Trump did not mention that Bill Clinton called it crazy. Anderson Cooper had to do that. Again, lack of preparation showing for Trump.]9:29: Questioner asks about Obamacare. Cooper tries to give Clinton the first bite at the apple. After Trump starts to answer, Clinton says let him take it. Trump says he\u2019s a gentleman so he will allow Clinton to answer. She says what Donald would have said was that he would repeal it while she will \u201cfix it.\u201d Clinton says people can\u2019t be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions and there are no lifetime limits under Obamacare. She says people under 24 can be on their parents\u2019s plans under Obamacare. She says, though, small businesses need additional help. Clinton says if we repeal Obamacare, \u201call of those benefits are lost to everybody\u2026\u201d [Classic. Put in a government program and make it impossible to repeal once folks need the benefits.]9:28: \u201cOkay, Donald,\u201d Clinton says. She says Trump wants to do anything to avoid talking about his \u201cexploding campaign\u201d and GOP establishment Republicans deserting him. Trump says the debate once again is a one-on-three battle.9:27: Trump says Clinton is again \u201clying\u201d about her deleted 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena. \u201cI am so disappointed in Congressman, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen,\u201d Trump says. He blasts Bill Clinton for talking to Attorney General Loretta Lynch nearly a month before the matter was decided.9:25: Clinton says he email scandal was a \u201cmistake\u201d and she\u2019s not \u201cmaking any excuses about it.\u201dcrowd in hall laughed when @HillaryClinton tried to say it was true that she deleted 30,000 emails #debate #debate2016\u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) October 10, 2016[Trump has an opportunity to say this election is about his words vs. a candidate who endangered the country\u2019s national security with her private email server. Will he?]9:24: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Trump says after Clinton says she\u2019s glad someone with Trump\u2019s temperament who is in charge of enforcing the country\u2019s laws.9:23: Trump says people\u2019s lives have been destroyed for doing a fifth of what Clinton has done and she should be ashamed of her actions. Clinton now says \u201ceverything\u201d Trump says was absolutely false re: her private emails.9:19: Clinton claims what \u201cso much of what Trump said is not right.\u201d A very legalese answer. She says \u201cso much\u201d but not \u201call\u201d or \u201ceverything\u201d as she tries to evade the question. She quotes Michelle Obama about going high when they go low. Clinton\u00a0says everyone can draw their conclusions about the man in the video or the man on stage respects women. Clinton now brings up the Kahn family to evade the question. Funny, the moderators aren\u2019t interrupting her like they did with Trump. Clinton brings up Judge Curiel. She accuses Trump of mocking a disabled reporter. She brings up Trump\u2019s \u201cracist lie\u201d that Obama was not born in the United States. Clinton says Trump has never apologized and owes Obama an apology. Trump says she owes Obama an apology because the Clinton campaign and her allies started the birther controversy. Trump now brings up some vicious commercials Michelle Obama cut in 2008 about Hillary Clinton. He now says Obama defeated her \u201cfair and square\u201d but Clinton didn\u2019t defeat Obama fairly because the election was rigged, citing the Wikileaks email dump. Trump says if he wins, he is going to instruct the Attorney General to get a \u201cspecial prosecutor to look into your situation.\u201d\u00a09:17: Raddatz again grills Trump on the tape. Trump says he is not proud of the tape and is a person who has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for people. Trump says if you look at Bill Clinton, \u201cmine are words\u201d and \u201chis are actions.\u201d Trump says nobody in the history of politics have been as \u201cabusive to women\u201d as Bill Clinton. Trump says Hillary Clinton attacked those victims viciously. Trump now informs the world that Hilary Clinton laughed at a 12-year-old rape victim. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me about words,\u201d Trump says. \u201cBut what President Clinton did\u2026 When Hillary brings up a point like that\u2026. I think it\u2019s disgraceful and she ought to be ashamed of herself.\u201d9:12: Cooper gives Clinton a chance to respond. She says she has spent the past 48 hours thinking about the tape. Clinton says she has never questioned the fitness of other GOP candidates to serve and she says \u201cDonald Trump is different.\u201d She says Trump is \u201cnot fit to serve\u201d as president. She says Trump claimed the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is but \u201cit represents exactly who he is.\u201d Clinton says Trump has insulted women and ranked women on their appearances while also embarrassing women on television and Twitter. She blasts Trump for \u201cdenigrating a former Miss Universe\u201d in harsh and vulgar terms. Clinton says it\u2019s not only the video that raises questions about Trump\u2019s fitness. She accuses Trump now of attacking minorities as well as she desperately tries to cobble together the Obama coalition. [Once again, Clinton schooling Trump on how to pivot. Trump should have said that though he made inappropriate comments, America needs someone who puts America first instead of the special interests and globalists. He needs to frame the election in this manner.]Trump shoots back on HRC says \"it's just words, folks, it's just words\"\u2014 Lauren Blanchard (@LaurenBlanch12) October 10, 20169:10: Cooper now brings up Trump\u2019s tape. Cooper says Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Trump says this is \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d He says he is not proud of it and has apologized for it. Trump\u00a0says he will knock the hell out of ISIS. Cooper keeps pressing Trump on the tape. He says he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for women while Cooper keeps pressing him on whether he has touched women without their consent. \u201cNo, I have not,\u201d Trump says before pivoting back to needing borders and making America safe and wealthy again.9:08: Trump says he entered the campaign because he got tired of seeing \u201cfoolish\u201d things being done by politicians. He brings up Obamacare, the Iran Deal (\u201cone-sided transaction\u201d with a \u201cterrorist state\u201d). Trump says America has tremendous potential and brings up the country\u2019s massive trade deficit. He says we\u2019re going to have a \u201cstrong border\u201d and \u201cbring back law and order.\u201d \u201cWe have to bring back respect to law enforcement,\u201d he says. Trump says he wants to do things that haven\u2019t been done, like fixing the inner cities to help African-Americans and Latinos/Hispanics.9:06: First questioner asks Clinton about how the last debate could have been rated \u201cMA\u201d and whether the candidates\u2019s behavior is appropriate for today\u2019s youth? (Clinton\u2019s lies re: her private email server is model behavior?) This gives Clinton a perfect opportunity to go over her talking points on a range of issues on various policy issues re: wanting to be a president for \u201call Americans.\u201d9:05: Trump and Clinton walk on stage. They seem tense and don\u2019t shake hands.\u00a09:02:Bill Clinton and Melania Trump shake hands along with the Trump family. #Debates #DebateNight pic.twitter.com/HCYM6KB5IZ\u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) October 10, 20168:58: Dana Bash in CNN points out that Bill Clinton does not have a good poker face, and he looks very, very uncomfortable tonight at the debate, especially since women who have accused him of sexual assault are in the audience with him.Bill Clinton accusers were just seated in the debate hall right in front of @SenatorDurbin : pic.twitter.com/yQSSVuKyEu\u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 10, 20168:57: Moderators Cooper and Raddatz now being introduced as the debate is about to begin.8:55: Coulter making great points:You have to ask yourself:  Why are the media & politicians so desperate to stop Donald Trump?

Why? The bottom line is Hillary Clinton is still a deeply flawed candidate who cannot connect well with voters. In addition, her support of open borders and globalist-first policies have prevented many undecided voters, especially working-class voters, from going to her side. And that\u2019s why, despite all of Trump\u2019s flaws, many of which have been self-inflicted, he still seems like the football team that is only one possession away in the second half from tying up the game despite having committed turnover after turnover throughout the game.2016 Presidential Race, Big HollywoodComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Parker and his college roommate and Birth co-writer Jean Celestin were accused of rape while at Penn State in 1999; Parker was ultimately acquitted of the charges, while Celestin was convicted but had his conviction overturned on appeal.The controversy caused a massive headache for the studio, which had hoped the film would be a favorite at this year\u2019s Academy Awards. Fox Searchlight initially worked to limit Parker\u2019s media appearances while some screenings of the film were cancelled amid growing backlash.Parker had mostly been kept out of the film\u2019s marketing activity until last week, when he sat for a\u00a0pair of television interviews on 60 Minutes and Good Morning America.\u201cI was falsely accused, I was proven innocent and I\u2019m not going to apologize for that,\u201d an unrepentant Parker told GMA host Robin Roberts last week when asked about the case.Meanwhile, the Hollywood Reporter reported that Fox Searchlight \u2014 which also conducted a voter registration drive ahead of showings of the film in small movie theaters in swing states \u2014 will now focus its awards efforts on its other buzzed-about upcoming film, the Natalie Portman-starring Jaqueline Kennedy biopic Jackie.Birth of a Nation \u2014 also starring Armie Hammer, Penelope Ann Miller, Jackie Earle Haley, Colman Domingo, Aja Naomi King and Gabrielle Union \u2014 scored a solid 79 percent from critics on Rotten Tomatoes and an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.The weekend\u2019s other new wide release, Lionsgate/CBS Films\u2019 teen-targeted Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life, brought in an estimated $6.9 million from 2,822 theaters.Holdovers Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children, Deepwater Horizon, The Magnificent Seven and Storks were projected to finish\u00a0in second, third, fourth and fifth place, respectively.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, box office, Fox Searchlight, Jackie, Nate Parker, The Birth of a Nation, The Girl on the TrainComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Because if you can do that in a national forum, that says to me that you are a damaged human being. If you can do that, and not apologize, you\u2019re a person to be shunned.\u201dLetterman also blamed the media\u2019s influence for Trump\u2019s victory in the Republican primaries.\u201cThe thing about Trumpy was, I think people just were amused enough about him to keep him afloat in the polls, because nobody wanted the circus to pull up and leave town,\u201d he said.In his interview \u2014\u00a0timed to promote his appearance in\u00a0the upcoming season of National Geographic series Years of Living Dangerously, which focuses on the effects of climate change \u2014 Letterman took aim at current late-night host Jimmy Fallon, star of NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show, who came under fire last month from critics who accused him of going too easy on Trump in a recent TV interview.\u201cIf I had a show, I would have gone right after him,\u201d Letterman told the paper. \u201cI would have said something like, \u2018Hey, nice to see you. Now, let me ask you: what gives you the right to make fun of a human who is less fortunate, physically, than you are?\u2019\u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s where it would have ended. Because I don\u2019t know anything about politics. I don\u2019t know anything about trade agreements. I don\u2019t know anything about China devaluing the yuan,\u201d Letterman conceded. \u201cBut if you see somebody who\u2019s not behaving like any other human you\u2019ve known, that means something.

Carlin on Thursday, Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) asked the DOJ to review and update\u00a0the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) in response to a significant rise in Chinese investment in Hollywood.In his letter, Culberson specifically cites the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda\u2019s acquisition of AMC Cinemas and Legendary Entertainment in the U.S. and its bid for Carmike Cinemas, along with\u00a0Hunan TV\u2019s investment in Lionsgate.Wanda acquired Legendary \u2014 the studio behind such films as Jurassic World\u00a0and\u00a0Godzilla \u2014 for $3.5 billion in January, and purchased a majority stake in AMC in May 2012 for $2.6 billion in cash.Culberson warned that the multi-billion dollar acquisitions \u201callow Chinese state-controlled companies a significant degree of control over the financing and content of American media that raises serious concerns about how this may be used for propaganda purposes.\u201dGerry Lopez, CEO of AMC Entertainment Holdings, left, shakes hands with Zhang Lin, Vice President of Wanda during a signing ceremony for Dalian Wanda Group Co. to acquire AMC Entertainment Holdings in Beijing, China, Monday, May 21, 2012. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)Culberson praised the DOJ in his letter for its warm reception of an Inspector General\u2019s audit of FARA which was published in September. The report recommended 14 changes to FARA \u2014 which was first implemented in 1938 in response to fears of Soviet or Nazi propaganda infiltration in America \u2014 to bring the regulations up to date, after its last review in 1990.The lawmaker also cited a report released by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission last October that found, according to Culberson, a number of \u201ctroubling examples of how agents of the Chinese Communist Party are exerting control of American movie content, both through direct ownership of studios and distribution as well as through coerced cooperation\u201d with Chinese government censorship agencies.Culberson went on to call attention to Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin, whom he says \u201cdoes not try to hide his close relationship with the Chinese government.\u201d The congressman said the DOJ would need to update FARA to address \u201cnew threats.\u201d\u201cIf, in fact, the law in its current form no longer effectively addresses these concerns, I urge you to provide legislative options Congress may consider to ensure transparency, full disclosure, and to mitigate this type of foreign propaganda influence over American media, which shapes not only the opinions of many within the U.S. but remains one of our biggest cultural exports to nations around the world,\u201d Culberson concluded his letter.The Texas lawmaker was one of 16 Congress members who last month asked the GAO to determine whether existing U.S. law had kept pace with rising foreign acquisitions in\u00a0the U.S. and particularly in\u00a0the entertainment industry. The lawmakers\u2019 letter to the GAO had also cited Wanda\u2019s purchase of AMC Theaters and Legendary Entertainment. The GAO agreed to review the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States in response to the lawmakers\u2019 petition.Culberson\u2019s letter comes after the Washington Post editorial board on Wednesday night questioned Wanda\u2019s interest in a billion-dollar acquisition of the U.S.-based Dick Clark Productions, which produces awards shows including the Golden Globes and the American Music Awards.\u201cIt is not far-fetched to assume that China would seek to spread pro-regime propaganda via ownership of U.S. entertainment media,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial board wrote.Read Culberson\u2019s full letter to the DOJ here.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Government, Big Hollywood, AMC Cinemas, Dalian Wanda, Department of Justice, John Culberson, Legendary Entertainment, propaganda, Wang JianlinComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The show follows an idealistic investigator for the Shin Bet (the Israeli equivalent of the FBI) as he deals with the ramifications of violent reactions on both sides of the escalating conflict.\u00a0A new command position thrusts him into a confrontation that undermines his faith and worldview, leading to a dramatic conflict between his values and the actions of those closest to him.\u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with Keshet and this extremely talented and creative group led by Hagai Levi,\u201d said Casey Bloys, president of HBO Programming.Keshet was also behind \u201cHomeland,\u201d an adaptation of Israel\u2019s \u201cPrisoners of War.\u201dAmerican networks have made multiple attempts to film TV series in Israel but the conflict-ridden region has often made the task impossible.

I\u2019m a grandmother of 12 kids so by now I\u2019m running out of fun things to do with them,\u201d audience member Robin Rick was instructed to say to Harvey, according to the memo. \u201cI\u2019m looking for new ways to entertain them so I was wondering, since Marjorie is a grandmother like me what are some of her favorite things to do with your grandkids?\u201dAs advised in the memo, Clinton was then introduced to the audience by Harvey. \u201cYou will enter the stage and assist Steve in Answering the question,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cAt this point he will show the picture of you and President Clinton holding Charlotte for the first time.\u201dThe memo acknowledges how the Clinton campaign believed Harvey\u2019s show to be a politically safe space, where Clinton could\u00a0easily\u00a0attract the attention of\u00a0female and African American voters.Harvey was instructed to \u201cfield 2-3 questions on his own\u201d while \u201cthe 3rd or 4th question would be outside his wheelhouse.\u201d\u201cPlease note that the tone of the show is generally light so even on policy questions, Steve won\u2019t go too deep into details,\u201d the memo said.There was also a pre-package segment of the show that was meant to highlight Clinton\u2019s personal life and her political achievements.\u201cDuring this segment Steve will take a trip down memory lane with YOU to talk about the different moments of YOUR life displayed in the photographs below,\u201d the memo read.From the\u00a0Flint water crisis to\u00a0crime and jobs, Clinton was briefed on topics that would be discussed during her interview.Despite the sit-down being completely choreographed, Clinton\u00a0feigned surprise throughout the interview. \u201cOh boy. Oh my goodness,\u201d she said when\u00a0Harvey showed\u00a0a photo of Clinton at 12 years old, even though she apparently knew the picture would be shown.\u201cAs happens with many shows like ours, producers conduct pre-interviews highlighting areas of interest and possible questions. This allows the guests to prepare for their appearance and provides the most informative experience for the viewers,\u201d Harvey\u2019s show said in a statement.Clinton\u2019s campaign has not yet commented on the memo.\u00a0Follow\u00a0Jerome Hudson\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0@jeromeehudson2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton, leaked memo, Planned Interview, Steve HarveyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Hamas rules the Strip with a firm hand and when it wants to get something or prevent something, it knows how to do that,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, Hamas has arrested dozens of Salafists in connection with the rocket attacks after Israel struck several tunnels and rocket launchers, some adjacent to the Israeli border, Breitbart Jerusalem learned.The Gaza source said that the latest round of hostilities cost Hamas millions of dollars, which apparently spurred the Islamic organization to act decisively against rowdy militants.The source said that Hamas hopes the latest clampdown will\u00a0send the Salafist dissidents a message that Hamas would not let the security situation deteriorate. He added that some of the detainees weren\u2019t suspected of taking part in the attacks, but were relatives of militants who had gone into hiding \u201cand can be used to provide useful information as well as send them a message that we mean business. We will not let Gaza become an IS launching pad.\u201dRadical Islamists have repeatedly challenged Hamas\u2019 central authority by goading\u00a0Israel into attacking Hamas targets, which has inflicted heavy losses on the struggling Gaza government.Speaking to Breitbart Jerusalem, a Salafi source said that the arrests included raids on homes of Salafi activists and their friends and relatives, saying that it wasn\u2019t simply a punitive measure against the attackers but an attempt to collect intelligence about members of jihadi groups.\u201cMany of the activists are former members of other organizations, including Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have split officially but others work for Salafi groups although they\u2019re still members of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Resistance Committees \u2013 and these are the ones Hamas wants to uncover.\u201d\u00a0Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Gaza government, Gaza Strip, Hamas, Islamic State, Israel security, jihadi groups, radical islam, salafism, West BankComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In fact, they\u2019ve been known to stretch the concept quite a bit.In May, Reuters reported that Chinese state-owned business entities have \u201cadopted a controversial defense when they face U.S. lawsuits: You can\u2019t touch us because we enjoy sovereign immunity.\u201dOne of these questionable claims of sovereign immunity was\u00a0made in response to a lawsuit over the infamous \u201cChinese drywall,\u201d defective building materials supplied during the U.S. housing boom that produces damaging chemicals when it degrades, leaving homeowners with thousands of dollars in repairs.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry \u201cargued in a diplomatic note that U.S. courts have no jurisdiction over suits against a country\u2019s \u2018state-owned properties,'\u201d invoking the U.S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976.Another case involved the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which challenged a $70 billion arbitration judgment in federal district court by invoking sovereign immunity as a state-run enterprise.\u201cI think there is a mentality in China that, hey, we are behind these big walls and nobody can touch us,\u201d trade litigator Bill Berry observed.\u201cThe use of sovereign immunity by Chinese state-owned conglomerates is a reflection of how China\u2019s state capitalism and legal regime is increasingly running into conflict with Western regulation and jurisprudence, particularly as the country\u2019s overseas investment rapidly grows,\u201d Reuters cautioned\u00a0in May.It\u2019s easy to see why China would have a keen interest in preserving sovereign immunity since so many of its business interests can invoke protection unavailable to fully independent private-sector corporations in the United States.Economics, National Security, China, JASTA, Saudi Arabia, sovereign immunityComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In November 2015, the Turkish government shot down a Russian fighter jet after the Russians had repeatedly violated Turkish airspace and ignored warnings from Turkish troops. The Russian military is present in Syria as an ally of dictator Bashar al-Assad, whom Erdogan has previously referred to as \u201ca more advanced terrorist than the Islamic State.\u201dReports so far do not indicate that Putin has discussed Syria with his Turkish counterpart. Instead, at remarks at the World Energy Congress, Putin discussed a new gas pipeline.\u00a0\u201cWe look positively at the Turkish Stream project. Our efforts are continuing,\u201d he said, adding a nod acknowledging that Erdogan remained in charge of the country after a failed coup attempt on July 15.\u201cWe are very glad that Turkey is recovering and wish it success,\u201d Putin told the audience. Despite the rift between the two nations over the Russian jet incident, Putin was among the first to reach out to Erdogan following the failure of that coup attempt. As Erdogan blames Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, for plotting the coup, Putin\u2019s overture came at a time when Erdogan\u2019s government was expressing strong dissatisfaction with NATO ally America.While the World Energy Congress will not address the Syrian civil war, Kremlin spokesman\u00a0Dmitry Peskov said the public should expect the bilateral relationship to improve \u201cin all aspects,\u201d which may mean some agreement on how to approach the Syrian situation.\u201cIt is expected that this visit, which comes as a follow-up to the two leaders\u2019 earlier meetings in St. Petersburg on Aug. 9 and in Hangzhou [China] on Sept. 3 on the sidelines of the G20, will contribute to further improving our cooperation and to accelerating normalization process between Turkey and Russia,\u201d the Turkish government had previously said of the meeting.As Putin arrived,\u00a0Turkish Prime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said Monday that Turkey and Russia now have \u201cthe same point of view\u201d on Syria, without elaborating.Russia initially entered the Syrian civil war to defend Assad, nominally from the Islamic State. But statistics regarding airstrike locations since Russia began bombing Syria show that they have largely been targeting non-Islamic State anti-Assad opposition. Russia is currently engaged in an extensive bombing campaign targeting civilians in Aleppo, where there is no significantly Islamic State presence.The UN Security Council attempted to pass a resolution against the bombing of civilians in Aleppo, but as Russia currently holds the presidency of that international body, the resolution was vetoed. Russia claims the resolution would have helped unspecified \u201cterrorists.\u201dTo enhance operations in Syria, Russia announced the establishment of a permanent airbase in that country.How Erdogan\u2019s longtime opposition to Assad \u2014 and calls for a no-fly zone over contested regions, which would significantly deter Russian military operations \u2014 will be squared with a desire to invite Russian business into Turkey remains to be seen, though Erdogan has expressed some flexibility on Assad. In August, Erdogan expressed a willingness to allow Assad to participate in peace talks, something that he had adamantly objected to for years.Middle East, National Security, America, Columbus Day, Egypt, Middle East, MuslimsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

There were no injuries to our sailors and no damage to the ship,\u201d said Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.Davis promised that the Pentagon would \u201ccontinue to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our ships and our servicemembers.\u201dA U.S. defense official anonymously informed Reuters that USS Mason deployed countermeasures when the first missile was detected, possibly thwarting a successful strike on the ship but did not return fire. The Mason was patrolling the same area where the Houthis fired on a vessel from the United Arab Emirates last week.CBS News reports the Houthis and their allies \u201coffered no reason for the launches, though they came after a Saudi-led airstrike targeting a funeral in Yemen\u2019s capital killed more than 140 people and wounded 525 on Saturday.\u201dThe White House swiftly condemned this Saudi airstrike. \u201cUS security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank check. Even as we assist Saudi Arabia regarding the defense of their territorial integrity, we have and will continue to express our serious concerns about the conflict in Yemen and how it has been waged,\u201d said U.S. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price, quoted by CNN.\u201cIn light of this and other recent incidents, we have initiated an immediate review of our already significantly reduced support to the Saudi-led coalition and are prepared to adjust our support so as to better align with US principles, values and interests, including achieving an immediate and durable end to Yemen\u2019s tragic conflict,\u201d Price added.The Saudi-led coalition denied responsibility for the strike, insisting that its troops \u201chave clear instructions not to target populated areas and to avoid civilians.\u201dCBS notes that Saudi state television aired footage of what appears to be a missile attack on Taif, the location of Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Fahad Air Base, where American military trainers are stationed.

(USA Today more specifically states it will be 28 miles southeast of the existing city.)A name has not yet been chosen for the new city, although Egyptian-born U.C.-Berkeley professor Nezar al-Sayyad\u2019s suggestion to call it \u201cSisi-land\u201d after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was not taken well. On a visit to Cairo last year, al-Sayyad\u00a0found himself explaining his satirical jab at the Sisi government\u2019s \u201ctop-down thinking\u201d to some un-amused security officers.Critics seem accordingly nervous about labeling the new capital city a boondoggle, or a feat of bureaucratic vanity, or a cruel diversion of much-needed resources away from crumbling Cairo, and they\u2019re\u00a0especially reluctant to discuss\u00a0the political advantage of moving the seat of government away from the protest-ready throngs of Cairo poor. Some in the government are not comforted by the sight of Tahrir Square, site of the \u201cArab Spring\u201d uprising, looming outside their office windows.Roads and bridges are under construction now, with Phase I of the project, and the first permanent residents of the new city, scheduled for completion within five years.Unfortunately for Egyptian planners, the population of Cairo doesn\u2019t seem interested in relocating (or, more poignantly, can\u2019t afford to relocate even if they want to.)Cairo University poli-sci professor Zeyad Elkelani told USA Today that government employment is often inter-generational in Egypt, with government workers passing conveniently-located Cairo apartments down through the generations \u2014 a tradition it sounds like the Egyptian government wants to begin gently discouraging, as it currently has about 7 million public workers on its payroll.\u201cThe new capital is an important step to make room for the private sector.\u00a0The bureaucracy has been choking business in Egypt and the residents of Cairo,\u201d Elkelani said bluntly, expressing hope for a \u201cwelcome attrition in government employment.\u201dProjects to create suburbs and satellite cities around the current Egyptian capital have produced largely unoccupied \u201cghost towns.\u201d The high-tech modernist style of these constructions is said to be unappealing to much of the Egyptian populace, which is bad news for the new Chinese-engineered capital city, whose mock-ups resemble\u00a0the futuristic dome city from \u201cLogan\u2019s Run.\u201dTo overcome such resistance, the Egyptian government is already announcing plans to shut down at least one major government building in Cairo, workplace for some 30,000 public employees, and convert it into a hotel by July 2017.In addition to the massive Chinese investment, companies from other countries, such as India and Saudi Arabia, have expressed interest in building projects. (The Saudi project is described as a \u201c12.6 hectare mosque and Islamic museum\u201d by CNN.) USA Today adds that the Chinese are interested in building a university for the new city.Middle East, National Security, Cairo, China, Egypt, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-SisiComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Santos and FARC terrorist leader \u201cTimochenko\u201d signed the agreement \u2014 which would have let most of the terrorists avoid prison time and run for office, establishing a political party likely to be funded with cocaine profits \u2014 before Colombia narrowly voted it down in a national plebiscite vote.The Nobel committee acknowledged Santos\u2019s efforts without praising the terrorist group, something which leftist elements have suggested was unfair to the terrorist group, responsible for at least 220,000 deaths and another 100,000 disappearances in their history.Maduro implied that he would nominate some of the FARC leadership to the Ch\u00e1vez Peace Prize.Ch\u00e1vez enjoyed a close relationship with the FARC, allowing them to operate\u00a0openly in Venezuela. Before Colombia voted \u201cno\u201d on the peace deal, anti-socialist Venezuelan opposition members publicly expressed concern that many FARC terrorists would move into Venezuela after being cleared of terrorist activity as part of the peace deal, adding to the already long list of political woes the Caribbean nation is currently facing.In addition to Maduro\u2019s ties to the FARC, he has long had a contentious relationship with Santos himself. After violently deporting\u00a0thousands of Colombian nationals, alleging that all Colombians were \u201cparamilitary\u201d members, Santos accused Maduro of using \u201cNazi ghetto tactics\u201d\u00a0against his countrymen which grossly violated international human rights norms.The \u201cHugo Ch\u00e1vez Peace Prize\u201d is reminiscent of China\u2019s \u201cConfucius Peace Prize,\u201d an award created as a response to the issuing of a Nobel to anti-communist Chinese dissidents.\u00a0\u201cI would like to say to those at the Nobel committee, they are orchestrating an anti-China farce by themselves. We are not changing because of interference by a few clowns and we will not change our path,\u201d a Chinese official said in 2010.Four years later, China granted the \u201cConfucius Peace Prize\u201d to mass murderer Fidel Castro.

Wikileaks published a more searchable version of the private speech database on Monday. Over the weekend, Democrats did not affirmatively deny the veracity of the documents in question, but Clinton running mate Tim Kaine told CNN, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can dig in documents dumped by WikiLeaks and just assume they\u2019re all accurate and true.\u201d He did not elaborate.In the speech in question, Clinton says she had a part in \u201chelping a blind Chinese dissident get safety in the American Embassy in Beijing and then negotiating with the Chinese to get him and his immediate family out of China.\u201d\u201cThat was one of those moments where you have to think hard about what America really stands for so when I got a call late one night saying that Chen Guangcheng had escaped from his house where he had been under house arrest, he\u2019d been picked up by sympathizers and he was on his way to Beijing and he wanted safety in the American Embassy, there were many who said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll totally destroy our relationship with the Chinese government,\u2019\u201d Wikileaks quotes Clinton as saying.Clinton allegedly made those remarks two years before Chen would write his memoir,\u00a0The Barefoot Lawyer, about his escape to the United States, but one year before\u00a0Clinton had published her own memoir,\u00a0Hard Choices. In that book, Clinton also took credit for freeing Chen, writing that she and other American diplomats did \u201cwhat Chen said he wanted every step of the way.\u201dChen\u2019s version of events in his 2015 differ significantly from Clinton\u2019s. Chen, who worked as an attorney in China\u00a0defending women the government forced to have abortions as part of its one-child policy, had been placed on house arrest for years due to his activism. In 2012, he escaped house arrest and fled to a U.S. embassy. There, he demanded political asylum for himself and his family.\u201cNo one seemed to be putting pressure on the Chinese Communist Party;\u201d Chen wrote of his experience at the embassy, \u201cinstead they were dumping shipping containers of weight onto my shoulders to get me to do their bidding. Suddenly I was overcome by sadness and wept.\u201d\u201cI hadn\u2019t expected so many people on both sides would be working so hard to get me to leave [the embassy], without guaranteeing my rights or my family\u2019s safety,\u201d he\u00a0added. Of the Obama administration, he wrote in his book, \u201cWhat troubled me most at the time was this: when negotiating with a government run by hooligans, the country that most consistently advocated for democracy, freedom, and universal human rights had simply given in.\u201dAmerican officials, he wrote, attempted to pressure him into staying in China under the auspices of a Chinese university, even after being invited by New York University to work on their Shanghai campus.Chen initially agreed to stay in China after what he described as immense pressure, but later recanted and demanded a seat on Hillary Clinton\u2019s flight out of China.

In several speeches that year, Clinton referred to Xi, who took office in late 2012, as a promising new leader for the communist country, particularly when compared to predecessor Hu Jintao.\u201cThe new president of China is a much more sophisticated actor than his predecessor. He lived in the United States for a short period of time, actually lived in Iowa on a \u2014 on a farm. He was working in agricultural issues within the Communist party, you know, about 30 years ago. He is a better politician than his immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao,\u201d Clinton is quoted as saying in a speech allegedly given to the CME group in November 2013, a year after he took office.The remarks echo a similar quotation from June of that year, where Wikileaks cites Clinton as saying, \u201cHe\u2019s a more sophisticated, more effective public leader than Hu Jintao was. He is political in the kind of generic sense of that word. You can see him work a room, which I have watched him do. You can have him make small talk with you, which he has done with me.\u201dIn that same speech \u2013 remarks at a Goldman Sachs event, according to Wikileaks \u2013 Clinton praised Xi for \u201cdoing much more to try to assert his authority\u201d over the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the Chinese military. She allegedly argued that Hu had \u201cnever really captured the authority over the PLA that is essential for any government,\u201d turning the PLA into something of a loose cannon \u201cmaking some foreign policy\u201d independent of the civilian authority of Beijing.\u201cSo President Xi is doing much more to try to assert his authority, and I think that is also good news,\u201d she reportedly said.Since Xi took office, the PLA has been significantly more active in the South China Sea, where Xi\u2019s government claims territory belonging to Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. A verdict from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague has done nothing to deter China from continuing to construct military facilities and artificial islands on territory it has no legal sovereignty over in the region.In that same speech, Clinton\u00a0accused the PLA of supporting North Korea, which China has been more vocal in condemning during Xi\u2019s tenure, though China remains Pyongyang\u2019s biggest trade partner and benefactor. \u201cThe biggest supporters of a provocative North Korea has been the PLA. The deep connections between the military leadership in China and in North Korea has really been the mainstay of the relationship,\u201d Wikileaks quotes Clinton as saying:So now all of a sudden new leadership with Xi and his team, and they\u2019re saying to the North Koreans\u2014and by extension to the PLA\u2014no. It is not acceptable. We don\u2019t need this right now. We\u2019ve got other things going on. So you\u2019re going to have to pull back from your provocative actions, start talking to South Koreans again about the free trade zones, the business zones on the border, and get back to regular order and do it quickly.Since Wikileaks claims Clinton made those remarks, praising Xi for getting tough on North Korea, dictator Kim Jong-un has conducted two more nuclear tests. After the earlier of the two, which occurred in January, the Chinese government claimed that containing North Korea was \u201ca U.S. obligation\u201d and that \u201c\u2018the U.S. should not always try to outsource its problems to China.\u201dThe Clinton campaign has not categorically denied the veracity of the documents. Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine said\u00a0he had \u201cno way of knowing the accuracy of documents dumped by this hacking organization\u201d on CNN.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think we can dig in documents dumped by WikiLeaks and just assume they\u2019re all accurate and true.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Hillary Clinton, National Security, China, Hillary Clinton, WikiLeaks, Wikileaks document dumpComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Xenakis10 Oct 20160This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nIrreecha festive on 2-October, prior to the deadly stampede (Reuters)The declaration of a six-month state of emergency is a major development, as Ethiopia has not declared a state of emergency for decades. However, the government has been increasingly rattled by growing anti-government protests, especially among the marginalized Oromo ethnic group, which comprises 34% of Ethiopia\u2019s population, and among the Amhara ethnic group, which comprises another 27%.The government is largely controlled by the ethnic Tigrays, who are a market and government dominant minority, comprising only 6% of the population. They are extremely authoritarian and have succeeded in marginalizing the other ethnic groups, and are said to have informants in villages throughout the country.According to Ethiopian officials:The Council of Ministers has declared a state of emergency that will be effective as of Sunday evening so as to deal with anti-peace elements that have allied with foreign forces and are jeopardizing the peace and security of the country\u2026The state of emergency was declared following a thorough discussion by the Council of Ministers on the loss of lives and property damages occurring in the country.We put our citizens\u2019 safety first. Besides, we want to put an end to the damage that is being carried out against infrastructure projects, education institutions, health centers, administration and justice buildings.A state of emergency has been declared because the situation posed a threat against the people of the country.The emergency will not breach basic human rights enshrined under the Ethiopian constitution and won\u2019t also effect diplomatic rights listed under the Vienna Convention.The state of emergency will help restore peace and security shortly. It is also intended to smooth the progress of the efforts being made to resolve the problem peacefully.The Ethiopian government is extremely authoritarian, and has always successfully met peaceful protests with arrests and violence. The government has not yet announced details of what the state of emergency will mean, but it is expected that the military will become even more in control, and may become even more violent. Fana Broadcasting (Ethiopia) and Deutsche WelleThe government considered the state of emergency to be necessary following violence at a peaceful protest last week. Dozens to hundreds of ethnic Oromo people were killed last Sunday (2-Oct) when security officials used teargas and gunshots to disperse protesters at the Oromos\u2019 annual Irreecha thanksgiving celebration in the town of Bishoftu. These actions triggered a stampede among the tens of thousands of people peacefully protesting against the government, resulting in the deaths.The Oromos are the largest ethnic group in east Africa, and make up 34% of Ethiopia\u2019s population, where they are split approximately evenly between Christianity and Islam.Most of them live in the Oromia region, which surrounds the capital city Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa is a major metropolis, and it has been growing and expanding. Last year, the government announced a plan to expand Addis Ababa into Oromo farmland, which triggered large scale protests. Massive protests in December 2015 caused the government to back down on the plan, but the protests have continued, because of deep poverty among the Oromos and what they see as marginalization.In recent weeks, the protesters have become violent, and they attacked businesses, putting at risk the government-portrayed image that Ethiopia is the best place in Africa for business investments. This has caused the government to appear desperate to restore stability, so as not to scare away the foreign investors. AFP and BBC and IRIN News and African ArgumentsThe kebeles are the smallest unit of local government in Ethiopia, and exist throughout the entire country, in both rural and urban districts. When the USSR-dominated communist government, known as the Derg dictatorship, was in charge prior to 1991, they were used by the government to exert local control.As I described recently in the  Generational history of Ethiopia and Eritrea, Ethiopia\u2019s last generational crisis war occurred in 1991, when the Derg dictatorship was overthrown. The new constitution promised human rights for everyone. Theoretically, the kebeles were then to become a democrat way of devolving central government power to the local authorities.An election in May 2005 threatened the power of the government dominant ethnic Tigrays, which are only 6% of the population. The kebeles became a powerful instrument for retaining power, according to Human Rights Watch in 2005:While originally intended to help implement the Derg\u2019s ambitious rural development agenda and land reform program, the kebele system quickly evolved into a highly effective mechanism of control and repression. Kebele officials were expected to keep their communities under perpetual surveillance and to report any subversive activities to higher authorities. The kebeles were also used to disseminate government propaganda, implement government policies and maintain general order and discipline. When the EPRDF came to power it retained the kebele as the smallest unit of local government throughout Ethiopia and has continued to use the system to consolidate and extend the power of the ruling party.In Oromia\u2019s rural areas, kebele officials wield a great deal of power over the populations they govern. Most of the region\u2019s rural population consists of subsistence farmers who depend upon kebele officials to provide them with a range of essential services and agricultural inputs. Perhaps most significantly, kebele officials distribute fertilizer to farmers throughout Oromia on credit and are responsible for collecting those debts when they come due. Farmers must also obtain letters from kebele officials verifying their identity and place of residence when they wish to access government services outside of their communities.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing.The pro-Western kingdom sealed its border with Syria in June, after a deadly cross-border attack claimed by Islamic State extremists killed seven members the Jordanian security forces. This has left more than 75,000 Syrians stuck between a war zone and a sealed border, without regular access to food, water and medicine.The displaced live in two makeshift tent camps in an area where the frontier is marked by two parallel low earthen walls, or berms. Conditions have become increasingly dire, with aid officials reporting the spread of disease, including whooping cough and hepatitis.Before the border closure, aid was sent from Jordanian soil. In August, Jordan permitted an aid drop by crane, in what was described at the time as a one-off shipment.U.N. agencies have since proposed setting up an aid distribution center between five and seven kilometers west of the largest encampment, known as Rukban, within the strip marked by the two berms, an aid official said. This would presumably have drawn the Syrians away from a Jordanian military base that is close to Rukban.However, Momani told The Associated Press on Monday that this is no longer being considered.\u201cThe new mechanism will be delivering aid on the berm through cranes, and the aid will be given to community leaders of groups of Syrians so they can distribute it accordingly,\u201d he said, adding it would be up to the aid agencies to decide on the pace of shipments.Momani said the border will remain sealed, citing an ongoing security threat to Jordan. The camps at the berm have been infiltrated by criminals, smugglers and extremists, he said.\u201cYou can describe part of it as a Daesh enclave,\u201d he said, referring to the extremist Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym.The two aid officials said nothing has been agreed on. One of the officials, who has direct access to the talks, said he was not aware of an emerging agreement on crane drops. He said another meeting was set for Tuesday.The suffering at the berm has caused some friction between Jordan and the international community.Aid agencies have been pressing for a resumption of aid from the Jordanian side.Jordan has said the international community needs to take responsibility for those stranded at the berm, and that the kingdom has already done more than its share in taking in Syrian refugees. In the past, Jordan has argued that this aid needs to come from Syrian territory, not Jordan.Momani said Jordan has taken the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d by offering to help.Close to 5 million Syrians fled civil war in their country since 2011, including close to 660,000 who settled in Jordan.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Daesh, Islamic State, Jordan, Mohammed Momani, Rukban, Syria civil warComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The schoolboy\u2019s family have since filed for compensation to the tune of $15 million from the City of Irving and the district school board.Incidents like these, Sharnoubi asserts, are little more than America\u2019s attempt to fool themselves and others.\u201cWhat terror are they talking about and associating with Islam or even with extremist Muslims or people claiming to be Muslims?\u201dMeanwhile, murders committed by the West, she writes, such as \u201cthe killing of civilians, women and children by American planes in Afghanistan and Iraq\u201d are not considered terror.Sharnoubi then regurgitates conspiracy theories surrounding the 9/11 attacks, saying the U.S. administration\u2019s official version of events is simply not credible.How is it possible, she asks, that American-trained Islamist pilots penetrated U.S. airspace and \u2013 despite \u201call their intelligence, satellites and radars\u201d \u2013 managed to carry out attacks at multiple locations without American forces downing the planes?\u201cOr was the whole thing planned in order to justify the war on terror?\u201d she continues.\u201cDoes it make sense that most Islamic State members are foreigners [i.e., Western nationals], unless IS is another story that was prepared in advance [by the West] to justify the devastation, partitioning and occupation [of countries] that is taking place and will continue to take place in the Middle East?\u201dShe brings more \u201cproof\u201d of her claim in the example of a\u00a0video clip showing Egyptian Christians being butchered by IS fighters who are \u201ctall, had the same white [skin], and wore identical expensive foreign-made watches?\u201dIn Sharnoubi\u2019s view, Western \u201cintelligence elements are behind the attacks and the bombings, and later Muslim citizens are arrested and killed and simply accused of perpetrating [the attacks] in order to justify what is happening in the Arab countries in the name of the war on terror, and in order to justify the plan to persecute the Muslims in the U.S. and Europe and expel them?

They said they decided to go ahead with the campaign even though the director is a \u201c1948 Palestinian,\u201d a term used to describe Israel\u2019s Palestinian community, because it is featured as an Israeli production.They referred to her quote on the Israeli news site Ynet, where she said: \u201cI\u2019m Palestinian and my movie is Israeli. It\u2019s been funded by Israeli film funds and I see no problem with it.\u201dThe campaign also disapproved of \u201cthe attempts to embellish the situation and to avoid hurting the feelings of Arabs in Israel by labeling it an Israeli-Palestinian production, but by doing that they made things worse. We don\u2019t recognize anything called Israel-Palestine, and neither do millions of Arabs. According to the overwhelming majority of Arabs, including the Lebanese people and the Lebanese state, it\u2019s an illegal entity that occupies 78 percent of historical Palestine. Adding the word \u201cPalestine\u201d to Israel does not absolve the organizers of legitimizing the appropriation of 78 percent of Israel.\u201dThey said that boycotting the film does not mean that \u201cwe have forgotten our people in occupied Palestine of 1948 [Israeli Arabs] who constitute, for us, a bulwark in our fight against Zionism. On the contrary, we strive to cooperate with our brethren there provided they do not label themselves as Israelis and refrain from cooperating with producers, directors, funders and actors.

In broad comparison with the wider Federal Government, the federal workforce dedicated to our national security and foreign policy is \u2013 on average \u2013 less diverse, including at the highest levels.While the administration said the lack of diversity does not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunities, the memo highlights actions that will facilitate the inclusion of a more diverse federal workforce.In a blog post that accompanied Obama\u2019s memorandum, national security adviser Susan Rice, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, Secretary of State John Kerry, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and\u00a0USAID Administrator Gayle Smith highlighted the need for the U.S. national security workforce to draw from the strength of America\u2019s diversity.\u201cNearly 40 percent of the approximately 320 million people in the United States are minorities, and an increasing number of them are earning college and graduate degrees,\u201d blogged Rice. \u201cAs America becomes more diverse, so do our best people. Yet, minorities make up less than 20 percent of our senior diplomats and 15 percent of senior military officers and senior intelligence officials.\u201dWhile President Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president, attempted to make diversity a trademark of his tenure, black Americans and Hispanics experienced high unemployment rates during his presidency.Big Government, National Security, Obama, diversity, federal workforce, Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce, White HouseComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

And 4chan of course \u2014 don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m working on saving it.But tonight we have to discuss a less exciting, but possibly more important aspect of the internet.If you\u2019ve ever wondered why you can type in a web address, like Twitter.com, from anywhere in the world and reach the same page, it\u2019s because of ICANN.Twitter may be a bad example actually. It\u2019s lost its most interesting and handsome user, fewer and fewer people use it, and the address might not exist much longer if they can\u2019t find a buyer\u2026. But you get the point.Let\u2019s compare the Internet to how people used to learn information, reading books. Does anyone here still read books? I guess some of you do \u2014 given that you\u2019re here at my talk, you are after all the students who still use your brains.So authors write books and publishers publish them. What would ICANN do in this case? They wouldn\u2019t be bookstores or libraries, and they aren\u2019t trucks carrying books to the stores or delivering them. Rather, they\u2019d ensure that anytime you picked up a book with a certain title by a certain author, you would get a copy of the correct book.You could look up the book I am writing \u2014 which will be amazing, by the way \u2014 and the ICANN of books would ensure that whether it was on amazon, your local bookseller, or a library, anywhere in the world, it would be the right book. On the Internet that is called DNS, and ICANN controls it. They would also have oversight on what title you choose for your book, by the way.I see some eyes glazing over, so I will wrap this section up with the important fact of how ICANN has operated. ICANN is a non-profit in California with a US government contract. They act as a monopoly, and have anti-trust exemption because of the US government\u2019s involvement.I know you\u2019re all conservatives, but rest assured that this is one instance in which the government has actually done a good job!Most crucially, because of U.S government involvement, ICANN must follow the first amendment \u2014 that pesky little law that authoritarians and the regressive left love to hate.Or rather, they used to. Because, thanks to Obama, ICANN is no longer in this great country\u2019s hands.Who did Obama give it to?Obama is the sort of American that believes everything about his own country is bad. You know the type. You\u2019ve probably met them in your gender studies department. He has worked to give away American control throughout his presidency, it started with bowing to world leaders all the time.His giveaway of ICANN might not even be constitutional, but then again, that\u2019s never stopped Obama before, has it?The short answer on who is taking over ICANN is that it is unclear. There are vague reports of a multinational organization. This is globalism in action ladies and gentlemen.Power handed over to opaque, vaguely-defined organizations free from any accountability.Tellingly, Google and all the usual Silicon Valley suspects are in favor of this change. They are the Soros types \u2014 the ones who are happy to use their power to impose their wacky progressive worldviews on everyone else.The other candidate isn\u2019t a corporation, or a government, but something much worse \u2014 the United Nations.Former US Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton recently said in an interview that within 10 years the Internet will be under UN control, and that the Internet as we know it will end.Those in favor of UN control of the government will usually say the same thing [whiney tone] \u201cInformation wants to be free, man, and it\u2019s like\u2026. TOTALLY wrong for the evil United States to monopolize it.\u201dThere is some truth there. Information and the Internet wants to be free \u2013 but only America has kept it free for so long. Only America with the first amendment has a true ideological and legal commitment to free speech. Countries around the world block portions of the internet and work to control what their citizens see, but the internet itself stayed free because ICANN was forced by the US government to keep it that way.Now, that will no longer be the case. Heaven help you if you are someone the member states of UN are not particularly fond of say\u2026. Oh\u2026\u2026 a dangerous faggot.These are countries known for their kebabs and murderous religious fanatics.And the cancer is spreading.In 2012 a UN treaty on Internet governance was signed by 89 countries. It wasn\u2019t signed by the US, because the US objected to language about international control of Internet governance.The head of the delegation said \u201cThe US has consistently believed and continues to believe that the UN treaty should not extend to Internet governance or content.\u201dIt only took four years for Obama to realize that his administration had actually done something good for freedom, and reverse it.In the words of one of my Breitbart colleagues, we are giving up control of the internet so that Turkey has as much say as America. We are doing that because Obama and friends thinks it is noble, that it is right to give all countries, no matter how despotic, a voice in managing the Internet.We know this is wrong. These countries don\u2019t deserve a voice on controlling the internet, because their M.O is censorship, oppression, and shadowy globalism.Let\u2019s take a look at the Rogue\u2019s gallery who will now control the Internet.First, China.\u00a0The Chinese in America are quite successful. Asian men, for example, have the highest average annual salaries in the United States. So much for white privilege!Some of the early pioneers of the Internet as we know it today were Chinese, like Jerry Yang who started Yahoo.Yahoo, of course, was once a great company, long before one of my favorite terrible female CEOs, Marissa Meyer, took the helm.But China\u2019s government is far more sinister and dangerous than its immigrants. After decades of murdering and starving their citizens, the Chinese turned their attention to controlling the internet.We have all heard of the great firewall of China, the complex methods China uses to filter vast portions of the Internet and block their citizenry from accessing information we take for granted. But that is just the start!In July, China banned online reporting. That would be \u201cbye bye Breitbart\u201d. If you\u2019re in China, only news from the government can be seen on the web now.You may think this is too far-fetched, but don\u2019t you think that Democratic administrations would love to shut down Breitbart? After all, Hillary Clinton talked about it in her alt-right speech, where she named my wonderful headlines as examples of wrongthink!China isn\u2019t even waiting for the UN to take over the Internet to mess around with it. China approached the owners of the .XYZ domain, which is now the fourth largest domain behind .com,.org and .net, to censor 12,000 words. They wanted to make sure no .xyz domains with politically unwelcome names would ever exist.For China, banned words include terms like \u201cDemocracy\u201d and \u201cLiberty\u201d. China and by extension the UN want an internet where a website cannot be called MiloForDemocracy.xyz and that is not the Internet you want to be on.Chinese citizens also have to be very careful what they post on social media, or they will be silenced.One quarter of the humans connected to the Internet live in China. Just imagine what that means. Except for the most clever and risk taking among them, one quarter of web users live a muzzled existence, cut off from the free flow of information and ideas.And a monitored one, of course. The ultimate goal of China and the UN is straight out of 1984. You don\u2019t know you\u2019ve violated the law until you\u2019ve been charged by the authorities.We should be challenging this country over its censorship, not giving it more power.\u00a0Next, Russia.Russia will assist China in ruining the Internet with the heavy hand of censorship. Russian Internet censorship rose 900 percent in 2015 according to human rights groups.One of the clever rules they\u2019ve developed is that any blogger that has more than 3000 readers must register with the government using all of their personal information, including their addresses. It\u2019s a not-very-subtle way of telling potentially influential dissidents: \u201cwe know where you live.\u201dThe Russian and Chinese model, followed by a growing number of nations, is to shut down so-called \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201csubversive\u201d websites. The definition of extremist and subversive is completely up to the government.Again, \u201cbye bye Breitbart,\u201d and bye bye dissidents, and anything else on the internet that globalists and authoritarian regimes deem to be \u201csubversive.\u201dWhy do we want corrupt officials and government cronies dictating what content is extremist and subversive?\u00a0And what about countries like Turkey? If a globalist behemoth like the U.N gets its claws on the internet, that will mean a backwards country like Turkey will have as much say as England. And Turkey\u2019s internet policies are as ugly as an overused goat\u2019s butthole.Turkey loves silencing social media, like Facebook and Youtube. And not just during coups either!Isn\u2019t it amazing that a country that has coups every second decade, that censors the internet, and has an Islamist President is a candidate for joining the European Union? These are supposed to be the \u201cgood Muslims.\u201d I\u2019m not impressed.Turkey has the sharia-compliant Twitter wrapped around their finger. They get whatever journalist they want booted off Twitter, and are the world leader for getting citizens banned from the platform.They also made it illegal to insult the president, and some poor bastard was arrested for making a meme comparing Turkish President Erdogan to Gollum.Most likely it is the first arrest in history for a meme. And it was an original one too! I mean, I know this will offend some of you, but after the 1 millionth Harambe joke I was in the mood for arresting people too.Turkey, like many countries, believe they have a sovereign right to control what information their citizens reach on the Internet. This is the opposite of what the Internet represents: the free exchange of information. And now, it is incontrovertible that Turkey and countries like it will have a greater say on how the Internet works. THANKS OBAMA!\u00a0Last, Saudi Arabia. Look, I couldn\u2019t possibly put this together without including Saudi Arabia. They are Hillary and Huma\u2019s BFFs, after all.Saudi Arabia follows the latest censorship tactics from the bad guys I\u2019ve already mentioned.\nIn 2014 they had 400,000 websites blocked, I wonder what the total is now? I\u2019ve found that block lists, whether they\u2019re from authoritarian regimes or triggered feminists only tend to get larger, not smaller. The lists always balloon, because censorship is both seductive and addicting.Much of the blocking is requested by religious leaders, and Saudi Arabia says its censorship is defending Islamic values.Presumably they aren\u2019t censoring the pedophile sites then!So while the west is flooded with muslim refugees who seek benefits in exchange for rape and murder, you can expect the Internet of the future to be as Sharia-Compliant as Twitter is today.I doubt they will find Tinder and Grindr to be very halal. In fact most porn is probably in danger, at least if the performers are over the age of nine.Ironically they will probably be perfectly fine with sites featuring interspecies action.Who on earth thinks letting Muslim nations have a say on how the Internet runs and what sort of sites should be allowed is a good idea? Your president, Barack Obama.\u00a0As I said earlier, control of the Internet will probably end up with the United Nations. There are lots of problems with that.One of them is that the UN loves taking up kooky feminist causes. If you thought Mugabe addressing the United Nations was bad, check these dykes out:If Anita Sarkeesian doesn\u2019t like being called an odious mendacious c**t, maybe she should stop being an odious mendacious c**t. It\u2019s not about her gender, it\u2019s about the bullshit that comes out of her mouth.A feminist controlled Internet is very dangerous. They hate masculinity, they hate men, and they also hate a nebulous term they use, \u201cCyber-Violence.\u201dCyber-violence, like \u201conline harassment\u201d and other terms cooked up by loopy feminist activists, is defined as anything that hurts feminists\u2019 feelings. Imagine the UN censoring everything that makes women unhappy.I mean, Chinese censorship is almost better! In their case at least you only have to worry about the Politburo\u2019s feelings, which are relatively stable. They don\u2019t go completely mental once a month.In late 2015 the UN put out a completely insane report called \u201cCyber Violence Against Women And Girls: A Global Wake-up Call\u201d which said:\u201cA cyber-touch is recognised as equally as harmful as a physical touch.\u201dIf only Father Michael had JUST cyber touched me when I was five \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be such a fag.In their press release, UN Women claim that \u201ccyber violence \u2026 places a premium on emotional bandwidth.\u201dThe report was so poorly put together that many references were left blank, and one, in fact, linked to one of the researchers\u2019 local hard drives. These people want to censor the internet and they don\u2019t even know how it works!Can you imagine what would happen if this organization got a hold of the internet? We\u2019d have to hope that their incompetence is stronger than their will to censor.That might just be the case. After all, the UN is notable for fucking up everything it sticks its nose into.Control of the Internet is like virginity. Once you give it away, you will never ever EVER get it back. That\u2019s why I carefully picked a special, romantic occasion \u2014 an interracial fivesome with two drag queens.America must control the Internet for the good of the entire world. Free speech is the essential component of freedom, and both in this country and around the world people must be able to speak out, learn, and participate in Internet culture.We must be able to do so without the control of Russia, China, and the Muslim world. We should be fighting those nations for control of the internet, not giving in.Thanks to the Obama administration, we must now add the Internet to the list of things that Donald Trump must save for America. I don\u2019t put much hope in congress stopping ICANN. After all, the Republican caucus still includes Paul Ryan.It\u2019s up to daddy, and to all of us, to fix this. Vote for Trump, spread the word, and educate your fellow students so they don\u2019t wake up one day to find that their favorite porn sites and the Milo homepage, which should be the same thing, are banned from the Internet.Follow\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero)\u00a0on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.

During the heated exchange itself, both sides employed repeated e-mail \u201cblasts\u201d to keep everyone as loudly on-message as possible.Both Clinton\u2019s \u201cGrassroots Tweeters\u201d and The Donald\u2019s \u201cBig League Truth Team\u201d hope to engage in the information age\u2019s newest brand of \u201crapid response\u201d guerrilla campaigning, carefully timing surges of social media activity at key strategic points, with precision timing. According to Chief Executive Joe Rospars of the Blue State Digital brand agency, this is an important part of both modern voter awareness, and the impression their following can make on mainstream media.Twitter is what passes for real-time conventional wisdom now.\u00a0You want people consuming bits of the debate with your framing on them. And you want them, through their RTs, to influence the press\u2019 impressions.Rospars should know: he headed up Obama\u2019s extremely successful digital campaigns in 2008 and again in 2012, including a \u201cFight the Smears\u201d initiative that encouraged supporters to spam their friends with information debunking rumors about then-candidate Barack Obama.Signing up for either network will mostly just get you an inbox full of campaign-related buzzwords, as well as requests to signal boost select messages. Especially popular users with substantial followers may be invited to an exclusive Slack channel by the Clinton campaign, or participate in exclusive conference calls with Trump\u2019s.Though the messages are similar, the content and tactics are notably different. While Clinton\u2019s camp encourages participants to spread messages from prominent Democrats, \u201cthird-party validators,\u201d and celebrities, Trump takes a more direct approach. You\u2019ll only be asked to generate buzz around tweets by the campaign or the GOP nominee himself, the vast majority of those directly focused on challenging his opposition.So far, it\u2019s difficult to say which strategy has proven more effective. Internet popularity is an inexact metric at the best of times, and social media has a uniquely short attention span.

The 1960\u2019s southern-fried crime drama is a brand new look for 2K\u2019s\u00a0cult classic Mafia franchise, and it\u2019s been turning heads even before the wildly elaborate E3 2016 display.Unfortunately \u2014 at least on PC \u2014 it seems to be starting its run\u00a0in a pair of cement shoes.It began with the discovery of a 30 frames-per-second lock on the PC port. That alone is enough to drive the hardcore PC gamer crowd a little bit wild, but in and of itself is not an irredeemable sin. Unfortunately, my\u00a0time with the game has already proven even that 30 FPS to be\u00a0uneven and jittery. It doesn\u2019t seem to be traditional slowdown \u2014 it\u2019s a difficult to define \u201cshuddering\u201d that isn\u2019t helped by the already low frame rate and some intensely smeary motion blur.Objects sometimes pop in and out of the screen seemingly at random, and some fail to load altogether. Some textures appear to be locked at the lowest level-of-detail, or else are bizarrely low resolution in comparison to the surrounding scenery. There are some mystifying artifacts in the aliasing as well, causing the edges of objects to flicker with jagged white lines unless directly under a bright light source.2K and Hangar 13 are already aware of the issues. Even before the official launch, they\u2019d\u00a0issued an apologetic blog post promising improvements to future performance. Since then, it\u2019s been updated to announce a patch this weekend that\u00a0\u201cincludes 30, 60, and unlimited frames-per-second options in the video menu, among other improvements for the PC version of Mafia III.\u201dUnless Hangar 13\u2019s development talents include time manipulation, it also seems as if they would have had to have known about these problems beforehand. Why they didn\u2019t choose to delay the game by a day or two in order to avoid the deluge of bad press and angry consumers is unclear.We\u2019ll provide our own review \u2014 beyond these initial missteps \u2014 \u00a0in the coming days.Follow\u00a0Nate\u00a0Church\u00a0@Get2Church\u00a0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.Tech, Mafia III, video gamesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Despite the success of the school\u2019s graduates, Bucknell students have become increasingly convinced that they are being held back by institutional oppression and discrimination.Jorden Sneed, 21, of Los Angeles and a senior at Bucknell, said she has attended the rally and march every year since she\u00a0started college.When she first started to come to the rally, she said they were much more intimate and shorter. However, \u201csentiments towards this march have changed since so much has changed in the world.\u201dSneed said, \u201cit is nice to see more people value the Solidarity March in the community. I believe it\u2019s important to have these rallies, marches, and events as it allows for our communities, Lewisburg and Bucknell, to come together on exposing these social issues that impact many of us on a daily basis.\u201dFellow Bucknell student Grevelin Ulerio, who performed Billie Holiday\u2019s classic protest song \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d and gave a small speech during the rally, said she wanted to tackle issues like white supremacy and anti-blackness head on.The 19-year-old sophomore, of Bronx, New York, originally planned to sing \u201cA Change is Gonna Come\u201d but changed her mind as she thought it was important to show what it means to be a black person in society.\u201cA lot of people see race as an identity, not as a position within society,\u201d Ulerio, who is a first generation Dominican American, said.Despite the seemingly well-intentioned sentiment of the event, the march merely operated as an extension of the calculated narrative being pushed throughout much of higher education.Ideas that counter the academy\u2019s narrative have become heresy. Those with an invested interest in the future of American education must begin to close their wallets and open their mouths if\u00a0tides are going to reverse anytime soon.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

Street9 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP published a report recently predicting that drone proliferation will soon be \u201cboosting crop yields, verifying insurance claims, assisting in future Hollywood blockbusters\u201d and be applied in thousands of yet defined opportunities.\u201cThe cost of drone technology is falling so quickly that a number of everyday applications are becoming cost-efficient,\u201d said Piotr Romanowski, a PwC partner and Business Advisory Leader. The new technology is allowing drones to create accurate three-dimensional maps and observe how they change over time, which could prove useful for infrastructure projects, verifying insurance claims and also for security applications, PwC said.But with a 6,000 percent growth expectancy by the end of the decade, rogue drone activity is increasingly in the news for interfering with fighting wildfires, running into commercial passenger jets, blocking policing, and invading personal privacy.As blowback, a Kentucky judge last year dismissed all charges against William Merideth for shooting down a drone flying over his home, based on the citizen\u2019s right to protect his privacy. The ruling kicked off a number of states moving to pass laws authorizing police, firefighters and other public safety officials the right to blow pesky drones out of the sky.The potential mainstreaming of vigilante activity\u00a0caused the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to issue an extraordinary national bulletin stating that under federal statute 18 U.S.C. 32, it is a felony crime to shoot down any aircraft, including drones.With increasing numbers of individuals firing errant bullets at quadcopters, the FAA warned, \u201cregardless of the situation, shooting at any aircraft \u2014 including unmanned aircraft \u2014 poses a significant safety hazard. An unmanned aircraft hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air. \u201dMany of the worst drone-war offenders are the burgeoning corps of free-lance photographers who can immediately sell \u201cbreaking\u201d overhead scenes of blood, gore or controversy to competitive media outlets for big bucks.To reduce the renegade droners\u2019 financial incentives, the U.S. Department of the Interior has begun a pilot program to give real-time access to data on all active wildfires to a couple of airspace mapping companies.Southern California-based AirMap is working with drone manufacturer DJI to create \u201cgeofences\u201d around wildfires. When a drone intruder hits the designated virtual boundary, geofencing software overrides the drone intruder\u2019s flight controller programing and forces the drone to hover in place. Any intruding drone attempting to launch inside \u201cgeofenced\u201d area will also be unable to lift off.Mark Bathrick, director of the office of aviation services at the Department of the Interior, told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cWe really want to have this new community of pilots be as responsible as the manned aircraft pilots that came before them.\u201dOther U.S. regulatory agencies are trying to get ahead of the rising\u00a0number of drone owners who\u00a0might try to interfere with such sensitive and high-risk areas such as airports, military installations, nuclear power plants, and prisons.Los Angeles avoided a potentially catastrophic event on March 19 at 2 a.m., when a full Lufthansa Airbus A380 passenger jet 14 miles out from LAX and descending to 5,000 feet on final approach only missed a drone by 200 feet, according to the FAA.Big builders of military drones like Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., along with a gaggle of start-ups, have all announced new initiatives to develop drone counter-measures \u2014 such as detection systems, controller interruption and laser cannons that can fry unwanted drones without spewing bullets that risk wounding or killing civilians.At the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s annual counter-drone demonstration, called Black Dart, the military revealed Boeing\u2019s compact laser weapons system, which\u00a0can disable or explode targeted drones in 15 seconds with a 2-kilowatt laser.Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, told the Times that with the commercial drone industry already experiencing exponential growth, counter-drone growth is likewise accelerating rapidly.\u00a0Breitbart California, Economics, Tech, Drone, FAA, geofenced, geofences, geofencingComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street9 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0L&F Capital Management suggests that Snapchat\u2019s current advantages are easily replicated, and that \u201cInstagram will ultimately consolidate the teen user base.\u201dThey see a Snapchat IPO as another one-trick-pony like GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK). All three had hot IPO\u2019s and a big jump in price in the first few days of trading. But within a year, competition swooped in and the companies\u2019 stock prices crumbled.A recent Wishbone survey targeting 35,000 Snapchat users between the ages of 12 and 25 found the company\u2019s primary competitive advantage is its filters. Geo filters and puppy dog faces are what the youth demographic currently wants for viral \u201cfun.\u201d But the survey also revealed that if Facebook had Snapchat-type filters, it would take market share from Snapchat\u2019s 12 to 25-age demographic.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram Stories launched on August 2, and already has 100 million daily active viewers, compared to Snapchat\u2019s 150 million users after almost five years. A big part of Instagram Stories\u2019 rapid adoption has probably been due to \u201cimmersion\u201d within the 500 million users in Instagram\u2019s ecosystem.L&F is confident that Facebook can continue to grow its earnings by 30 percent compounded, because the falling \u201cCost per Engagement\u201d for the Instagram and Facebook platform is a magnet for advertiser dollars and an impediment for other social media platforms.Snapchat is the primary target in the\u00a0Facebook\u2019s app consolidation plans. By knocking off Snapchat\u2019s core features, Facebook will strengthen its user base and take share in the youth demographic, where advertisers desperately want to increase engagement.Snapchat currently has an advantage when it comes to private direct messaging, but that feature is easily imitated. Facebook is already testing a similar tool with Messenger. By enabling short-lived direct messaging text, photos and videos, Messenger would seem to be a huge threat to Snapchat\u2019s value proposition to users.Instagram Stories already addresses the public messaging components, and when combined with Facebook Messenger features, it could also offer the kid-targeted private component.L&F believes that with all the hype around Snapchat, the stock price will undoubtedly jump after the IPO.

There is a problem when perfectly respectable, reasonable, mainstream opinions become prescribed by the media. What I\u2019m about to do is draw attention to something they don\u2019t really want to speak about very often, they don\u2019t want to talk about this often. I\u2019m a gay man who flew down to Orlando after an Islamic lunatic murdered fifty people and injured another fifty, after seeing what has happened in Britain and Europe, as a warning from the continent, I don\u2019t want you to go the same way.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want America to become like Germany. With accident and emergency departments where doctors are being spat on because they\u2019re female. And doctors are being stabbed because fail to save the lives of male children. I don\u2019t want America to become that because we rely on you guys, we love you, we trust you and we rely on you, without a strong America we\u2019re left with China and Russia so coming from Europe, having seen what the sort of weak, globalist politics does for people.\u201d\u201cHaving seen what left wing establishment politics accomplishes when it is allowed to run riot, I want to come to you here in America to tell you that there is a different way, there\u2019s a better way and it is cleaving to the principles on which this country was founded. It is remembering that freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, capitalism, property rights, these are the things that make America the best country in the history of human civilization.\u201d\u201cAmerica is the kindest country to minorities, it treats women, blacks, gays, trannies, whatever minority you choose to identify with, it treats them the\u00a0best out of any country anywhere in the world and when the left looks at this country it sees a history of oppression, bigotry and constructs a variety of conspiracy theories as to why they\u2019re still f**king unhappy. When I look at America coming from Europe, which is a relatively enlightened continent, I see country which has taken the best of humanity, freedom of expression, property rights, all of the things that allowed people to flourish and its created a country out of those ideas. This is not a country not created out of ethnicity or geography, this is a country created\u00a0according to reason and ideals and those ideals are the best basis\u00a0that anybody has yet come up with, with which to found a country.\u201d\u201cThe left, Hillary Clinton being the largest and greatest incarnation of that, the left in America is determined to unravel the founding documents of this country. They hate the first amendment, they hate the second amendment. You cannot allow that to happen, they cannot allow the identity politics of the left to take control of your civil society. You cannot allow the progressive left to start privileging Islamic terrorists over women and gays who\u00a0already live here. \u00a0You cannot allow the insane identity politics, the ludicrous and prejudiced, bigoted crazy ideas of the left to distort the principals that created the best nation that our species has come up with\u201dThe event can be watched in full at the livestream below.Milo, Tech, #DaddyWillSaveUs, Donald Trump, Lucian WintrichComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He was thrown out of his first venue and faced legal threats over his proposed exhibit.Shortly before\u00a0the groundbreaking show got underway, he sat down for a phone interview with Breitbart Tech\u2019s\u00a0Allum Bokhari about the event,\u00a0the controversy surrounding it, and the thoughts of the man behind it all.Allum Bokhari: When\u2019s the last time that this has happened, that someone was barred from a gallery for the politics of their exhibit?Lucian Wintrich: I believe it was Mapplethorpe and it was the conservative Christians and evangelicals (who were protesting). It is an example that the left is just as if not more reactionary.A: Do you think the scales have tipped then, that it\u2019s now the left who are the new \u201cMoral Majority?\u201dL: I think that the scales have more than tipped. You look at the left right now saying \u201cyeah we\u2019re gonna beat the shit out of you, watch your back.\u201d When the Christians were protesting that, they weren\u2019t necessarily inciting violence; they were saying \u201cyeah we\u2019re not gonna touch you but you\u2019ll burn in hell later on.\u201d So I think I\u2019d prefer that threat. I have been a little bit freaked out (by the leftist protesters) but at the same time, these people are so used to that method of intimidation and coercion that it\u2019s sort of worn thin I think.A: So tell me about yourself. How does a gay photographer who works for media companies in New York become a Trump supporter?L: Well I absolutely despise Clinton and I think Trump is a brilliant representation and embodiment of how we can help turn around what I feel to be a terrible direction that this country is currently headed in. Clinton\u2019s so untrustworthy and such a panderer that she will find the lowest common denominator, regressive emotion which stifles culture, stifles art. It holds us back and it puts us in a place that Germany knew very very well until cultural notions sort of took hold there. And now they\u2019re sort of crashing and burning and I think that will very soon be seen in their economyA: Are you referring to Germany\u2019s immigration problem?L: Yes, yes, mostly I think it\u2019s a combination of their immigration and they have the same sort of regressive oversensitivity where \u201cmy god we can\u2019t really say anything, we need to respect every single thing that we\u2019re told to respect\u201d and it\u2019s tip toeing. When did Western culture become so scared of Western culture? It\u2019s unfortunate and I think Trump is helping to change that. Even this nonsense that came out where he was accidentally recorded or left the lavalier on his jacket on. The people that are saying \u201cthis is outrageous, this is disgusting,\u201d I don\u2019t know if they have friends and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve ever just sat down at a bar for an hour. I mean that is typically how a lot of Americans talk and I feel like fifty years ago it would have been laughed off. There\u2019s also this thing going on right now in the world where almost everything is recorded and everything is documented and filmed and photographed. Either we have future politicians in one of those Plato\u2019s republic type of scenarios where they\u2019re not exposed to any elements of the more crass elements of American culture and then we throw them into the American eye after they\u2019ve lived this sheltered closed life\u2026A: Isn\u2019t that what Clinton is to some extent? She\u2019s been in politics for more than half her life.L: Oh she really is and she\u2019s bringing back a bunch of cronies who are part of that world where their actual only job is to maintain power. They were raised and they were continuously told all they had to do was maintain power at any cost. Trump not so much. I mean he definitely has a sense of capitalism and business power, the whole point of business is to advance but it\u2019s completely different to the coercive power of politics. Which is why I\u2019m more of Goldwater conservative. Some of Trump\u2019s policies I think might be as wonderful as those of Goldwater and he does still embody a large portion of the conservative spirit and conservative ideology. People say \u201cwell Hillary Clinton is more conservative than some Republicans\u201d and yeah, but the parts of her that are conservative are the worst parts of the platform. And what Trump has absorbed from the conservative party and the American populace in forming his policies I think is vastly more reflective of the climate we\u2019re in right now and what we need to advance as a country.A: Why did you choose the artists that you chose?L: Over the course of the last month or so a bunch of my pieces were sort of propagating online, a lot of other conservatives, about 50 conservative artists reached out to me. Some of them were terrible, as is to be expected, and some of them were fantastic. And I think what I really was going for in the final selection of artist was diversity of ideologies within the party, different worldviews, and as many mediums as possible, so we don\u2019t really have too many of the same form of art. Obviously with Milo, he gave a drag performance in front of 2500 young Republicans at LSU, so that is like a form of educational performance art. I think Milo\u2019s talk is absolutely brilliant art and I don\u2019t think a lot of people recognise that. I\u2019m especially excited about Milo\u2019s piece. \u00a0A lot of people on the left expect to hate him. They have no idea what he\u2019s actually doing, what he\u2019s saying and what the actual cultural benefit is of what he\u2019s achieving right now. He\u2019s a brilliant conservative mind and he\u2019s absolutely an artist and so with this show, we\u2019re putting it in New York which is the heart of the art world. So we\u2019re taking an artist to a place where many people don\u2019t know that his character is a large part of his art and we\u2019re bringing him into that world. So it\u2019ll be interesting to see how people react to that and if they sort of, I dunno, everythings open to interpretation.A: There was talk of potential protests by activists ahead of the event. Do you envision any trouble?L: I think literally anything could happen. I think that the protesters might just be pussies because of the rain, maybe they won\u2019t show up. I haven\u2019t heard anything leaked through the grapevine, I tend to think liberals are generally stupid but maybe they got smarter and figured out a better way to execute this. But really anything could happen, very luckily we do have four navy seals working security, we have the new york fire department, so I don\u2019t think they can slip in necessarily. This is a fairly controversial show so I don\u2019t know. If the birdman can break out of Alcatraz then I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one liberal was able to slip through the doors.A: People talk about the enthusiasm gap, and\u00a0I don\u2019t see many art shows being planned for Hillary. A lot of people are voting for her because they hate Trump or they just don\u2019t want the Republicans to win, but they don\u2019t seem very enthusiastic about her. Do you think this art show is another example of this gap? I mean, I don\u2019t think there\u2019d be an art show for Jeb Bush either\u2026L: I do think that there\u2019s far more young people excited for Trump than there are excited for Hillary and that\u2019s sort of everything. If you read all the arguments for supporting Hillary they\u2019re just \u201coh well she\u2019s better than Trump.\u201d And that sort of notion or idea that \u201coh ok well I guess mom if we\u2019re having Tofu for dinner it\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d that\u2019s not really going to elicit the same sort of excitement and an expression in the art as a candidate like Trump. And I think inherently he lends himself to art. He\u2019s a celebrity and before this election he was a very loved figure by everybody, left or right in New York and he\u2019s a pop culture icon. So we\u2019re just sort of translating that to a variety of mediums.A: Final question:\u00a0you mentioned Germany and western culture earlier, do you think artists these days, especially left leaning ones, tend to not be so keen on western culture, would you like to see more artists celebrate western culture instead of denigrate itL: Oh absolutely! Absolutely! If not for western culture they wouldn\u2019t have the ability to express themselves, the enlightenment in the arts and literature and everything else, it\u2019s a byproduct of western culture. It\u2019s unfortunate and I do think that a lot of artists are very politically stupid and I know plenty of truly incredible artists in New York who are brilliant painters and brilliant photographers and they\u2019re so blind and led by leftists because that\u2019s the culture that they know. I think they have a wonderful sort of technical skill but no real understanding of what they\u2019re talking about politically.You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.\u00a0Email tips and suggestions to abokhari@breitbart.com.Milo, Tech, #DaddyWillSaveUs, Lucian WintrichComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Flynn10 Oct 20160If you found yourself in the Orange Bowl on November 12 of that year, you witnessed one of the great title fights in boxing history. Aaron Pryor, Alexis Arguello, and 30,000 or so of the Nicaraguan\u2019s closest friends flowed into the football stadium for The Battle of the Champions, in the conversation for the best megafight of a decade bursting with them.Pryor came out unleashing bombs from the bell, dipping down and rising to throw haymakers. He combined two favorites of fans, volume and power, to win rounds and much of the crowd. Arguello enjoyed limited success boxing at a distance, dodging blows, and countering when the fight moved into a phone booth in rounds two and three. In the third, he briefly knocked Pryor through the ropes, which brought a showman\u2019s shimmy in response, and caught the Hawk off balance after the Cincinnatian fired a characteristically looping shot. But Pryor fought his fight effectively, and frenetically, in the bout\u2019s first half.Arguello, utilizing a jab and straight punches but stalking in an almost flat-footed manner, looked like a textbook boxer from the waist up; Pryor, utilizing footwork but relying on uppercuts and looping punches, boxed from the waist down as he brawled from the waist up. This played to Arguello\u2019s advantage in the second half of the match. He rocked the slowed and occasionally out of position WBA super lightweight champion with an uppercut in the tenth and scored a series of sensational straight rights in the eleventh. By the thirteenth, when Arguello snapped the Ohioan\u2019s head back, HBO\u2019s Barry Thompkins noted: \u201cI believe a little bit of the starch has gone out of Aaron Pryor\u2019s legs.\u201dThen, in between rounds, that starch strangely returned. \u201cGimme the other bottle,\u201d trainer Panama Lewis infamously interjected in the corner, \u201cthe one I mixed.\u201d Pryor imbibed a fountain-of-youth elixir that preceded him teeing off on Arguello against the ropes, which coaxed the referee to halt the 140-pound fight in the fourteenth.The technical knockout remains one of the most controversial in boxing history. Panama Lewis, banned from the sport about a year later for employing tactics that ran afoul of the Marquess of Queensberry\u2019s perhaps na\u00efve vision of a gentlemanly sport, calling for a mysteriously water bottle\u2014not Arguello stopped while still standing\u2014makes it so. What did it contain? Peppermint Schnapps? Cocaine? Antihistamine? We don\u2019t know. We know only that Pryor came out for the fourteenth round as though the first.Sugar Ray Leonard observed live on the HBO broadcast, \u201cI don\u2019t know where he got the energy from.\u201d Many of Arguello\u2019s partisans believed they knew precisely where it came from. The undefeated pugilist quelled the controversy somewhat with his knockout of Arguello in a return engagement the next year in Las Vegas. But the bottle, like the boxer, remains the stuff of legend.E.T., \u201cEye of the Tiger,\u201d Atari, and Aaron Pryor were really big in \u201982. Unfortunately, cocaine was really big in \u201982, too. No man could take the Hawk\u2019s title\u2019s from him. But coke eventually did.Too bad for boxing. Bouts with Ray Mancini, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, and other cash cows never materialized in part because the bout with addiction (and the usual bad boxing mathematics), one which Pryor eventually won, did. But the classic fight with an 83-5 Nicaraguan materialized. And for that, boxing fans offer gratitude.Like Alexis Arguello and 15-round title fights, Aaron Pryor is gone. The Hawk left us for good this weekend after a battle with heart disease. But Pryor, like so much else big in \u201982, lives on forever on YouTube.\nBreitbart Sports, Aaron Pryor, Alexis ArguelloComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Western Michigan 6-0 [Defeated Northern Illinois, Last Week #21]\u2014I like Western Michigan, but they do not deserve to move up after defeating a one-win MAC opponent.21. Auburn 4-2 [Defeated Mississippi State, Last Week NR]\u2014For the first time in a long time, the Auburn football program enjoys some momentum behind it. Now, it needs to make the most of the next two weeks as they prepare for Arkansas.20.

Miami 4-1 [Lost to Florida State, Last Week #11]\u2014It was a heart-breaking loss to FSU, but there is still plenty to play for in Mark Richt\u2019s first season.17. Florida State 4-2 [Defeated Miami, Last Week NR]\u2014I am probably being too forgiving with the Seminoles, but this is a team with the talent to really jump off after the surprising win over Miami.16. Boise State 5-0 [Defeated New Mexico, Last Week #19]\u2014The Broncos continue to roll without a team on the schedule that, on the surface, looks like a potential threat.15. Virginia Tech 4-1 [Defeated North Carolina, Last Week #24]\u2014At the beginning of the season, I thought the Hokies and their quarterback Jerod Evans would be among the season\u2019s surprises. Despite the loss against Tennessee, this team still can be a factor this year.14. Oklahoma 3-2 [Defeated Texas, Last Week #16]\u2014It says a lot (or a little) about the strength of the programs outside of the top 10 that the Sooners are a top-15 team given their lack of strong showing this season.13. Nebraska 5-0 [Bye, Last Week #14]\u2014Now rested up, Mike Riley\u2019s team still has visits to Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Iowa on its schedule.12. Ole Miss 3-2 [Bye, Last Week #13]\u2014After a bye week, the Rebels enter a season-defining stretch at Arkansas, at LSU, and against Auburn. It is a long shot, but this team still has a sliver of hope to make the playoff.11. Baylor 5-0 [Bye, Last Week #12]\u2014IF the Bears remain undefeated, will anyone care? I tend to think a one- or even two-loss champion from the other Power 5 conferences might get preference given the abysmal state of the Big 12.10. Tennessee 5-1[Lost to TAMU, Last Week #9]\u2014I don\u2019t know about you, but I was getting a little tired of the Vols waiting until the fourth quarter to start playing winning football. This team has a chance to get back in the playoff picture against Alabama this week.9. Wisconsin 4-1 [Bye, Last Week #9]\u2014Only Tennessee may have a stronger ability as a one loss team to make a run to the playoff. The Badgers took a week off after a narrow loss on the road to elite Michigan and get three big games to re-emerge in the playoff hunt.8. Houston 5-1 [Lost to Navy, Last Week #4]\u2014It now appears clear that the College Football Playoff will be a purely Power 5 affair. Do not be surprised to see Houston leapfrogged here if bigger conference teams ranked lower make a run.7. Louisville 4-1 [Bye, Last Week #7]\u2014Finally, a week in which Lamar Jackson failed to put up mega stats. Of course, that\u2019s only because he wasn\u2019t playing. The Cardinals still have a shot at the playoff.6. Texas A&M 6-0 [Defeated Tennessee, Last Week #8]\u2014College football breathed a sigh of relief when the Vold\u2014who seem to abhor the idea of having a lead\u2014fell to the Aggies. While the victory was not overly impressive, Kevin Sumlin has two weeks to get his team ready for a visit to Tuscaloosa.5. Washington 6-0 [Defeated Oregon, Last Week #6]\u2014Chris Petersen has the Huskies in control of their own playoff destiny after completely thrashing Oregon.4. Michigan 6-0 [Defeated Rutgers, Last Week #5]\u2014The Wolverines head into a midseason bye week after absolutely annihilating lowly Rutgers. Harbaugh has the revival well under way in Ann Arbor.3. Clemson 6-0 [Defeated Boston College, Last Week #3]\u2014We finally saw the kind of margin of victory we expect from the Tigers. Still, Michigan and Washington both have an argument to be ranked higher than last year\u2019s #2 finisher.2. Ohio State 5-0 [Defeated Indiana, Last Week #2]\u2014Ohio State managed to defeat a much improved Indiana squad. The first direct comparison against Michigan comes in this week\u2019s matchup at Wisconsin.1. Alabama 6-0 [Defeated Arkansas, Last Week: #1]\u2014Victory was never in doubt against Arkansas, but, while this team still looks good, I am no longer convinced the Tide are head and shoulders above everyone else. Tennessee and Texas A&M are next.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In fact, our own data shows that perception of the NFL and its players is actually up in 2016,\u201d stated league executives Brian Rolapp and Howard Katz in a memo sent to NFL teams.Some around the league blame bad early season matchups for the ratings decline. If that is the case, this week will be a good litmus test because of the number of excellent matchups, including Atlanta at Denver, Houston at Minnesota, New York Giants at Green Bay, Cincinnati at Dallas, and Tom Brady\u2019s return to action in ClevelandLet\u2019s take a closer look at Sunday\u2019s action.Washington Redskins (2-2) at Baltimore Ravens (3-1)Washington\u2019s defense is struggling, and not just because of the Iran deal. The Redskins allowed Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Cody Kessler to complete 67 percent on third down last week.Baltimore is coming off their first loss of the season at the hands of Oakland, a game in which their vaunted pass rush registered no sacks.The battle of the beltway could go either way.Atlanta Falcons (3-1) at Denver Broncos (4-0)Exciting matchup on paper featuring the NFL\u2019s top offense (Atlanta) against the league\u2019s best defense (Denver).The Falcons average 478 yards and 38 points per game, but haven\u2019t faced a defense any where near this caliber.With starter Trevor Siemian nursing a shoulder injury, the Broncos will start rookie Paxton Lynch.This game is a toss-up.Houston Texans (3-1) at Minnesota Vikings (4-0)The injuries keep piling up in Minnesota, but they continue to find ways to win.They already lost their quarterback (Teddy Bridgewater), star running back (Adrian Peterson), and left tackle (Matt Kalil) for the season. This week they will be without right tackle Andre Smith and an emerging star at receiver, Stefon Diggs.Perhaps this is the week all these injuries take their toll on the resilient Vikings.Tennessee Titans (1-3) at Miami Dolphins (1-3)People are quick to criticize Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill for his pedestrian play this year, but it would help if the Dolphins protected him better. The fourth-year signal-caller has been sacked 11 times in four games.\u201cI think we can do a better job of actually blocking people,\u201d said Dolphins coach Adam Gase.Getting franchise left tackle Brandon Albert back from an injury will help.The Titans 27th-ranked offense doesn\u2019t scare many teams.The Dolphins at home should figure out a way to win.New England Patriots (3-1) at Cleveland Browns (0-4)Patriots QB Tom Brady returns from a four-game suspension, but don\u2019t expect his usual dominating self from the get-go, according to his coach.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for a player not playing football to practice playing football,\u201d said Patriots coach Bill Belichick.But even as Brady works out the kinks, the Patriots still should have little trouble beating the beat-up, rebuilding Browns.Cincinnati Bengals (2-2) at Dallas Cowboys (3-1)While rookie quarterback Dak Prescott has done a solid job helping Dallas to a 3-1 start, he hasn\u2019t faced a defense as good as this.A big help for Prescott the last couple of games has been the work of fellow rookie, tailback Ezekial Elliott, running behind a great offensive line.Bengals cornerback Adam Jones joked Elliott hits holes so big \u201cmy little girl could run through them.\u201dDon\u2019t expect that to be the case this week against the Bengals talented front seven, and don\u2019t be surprised if the road team wins this game.New York Giants (2-2) at Green Bay Packers (2-1)The Packers are fresh coming off a bye week.The Giants are coming off a short week following a Monday Night Football road game, and have a ton of injuries in their secondary, which is far from ideal facing Aaron Rodgers.All signs point to the Packers in this game.Philadelphia Eagles (3-0) at Detroit Lions (1-3)The Eagles are 3-0 and healthy coming off a bye-week.The Lions have lost three in a row and have major injuries problems.But all the Lions losses have been very close games.The game could go either way.Buffalo Bills (2-2) at Los Angeles Rams (3-1)The Rams are one of the NFL\u2019s surprise teams, getting off to a 3-1 start.And this with their star tailback Todd Gurley struggling.A big reason for their success is a stout defense led by coordinator Gregg Williams, one of the game\u2019s best.The Rams defense, along with game-managing QB Case Keenum, should spearhead a win over visiting Buffalo.San Diego Chargers (1-3) at Oakland Raiders (3-1)The NFL season is only a month old, and the Chargers already have 15 players on injured reserve.One bit of good news on the injury front is that first-round pick, end Joey Bosa, will make his debut after battling a hamstring injury.While the Raiders look like the clear favorite in this game, it\u2019s always a mistake to count out the Chargers led by their indomitable QB Philip Rivers.New York Jets (1-3) at Pittsburgh Steelers (3-1)Two weeks ago the Steelers were blown out by the Philadelphia Eagles. Last week, they blew out Kansas City.What was the big difference in the two games?\u201cLe\u2019veon Bell,\u201d said Steelers coach Mike Tomlin.Bell, a gifted tailback who was suspended for the season\u2019s first three games, accounted for almost 200 yards of offense in his return last week. He\u2019s not just a superb runner, but an outstanding receiver.The Jets are a mess right now. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick has thrown nine interceptions in the last two games, and their pass defense is one of the NFL\u2019s worst.The obvious pick in this game are the Steelers, but don\u2019t be shocked if the Jets keep it close. They play better on the road and are desperate.Chicago Bears (1-3) at the Indianapolis Colts (1-3)The Colts defense has been awful this year. Why?\u201cWhen you pay (quarterback) Andrew (Luck) what we did, it\u2019s going to take some time to build on the other side of the ball,\u201d said Colts GM Ryan GrigsonEven with their defensive issues, the Colts should figure out a way to beat the pedestrian Bears.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

We don\u2019t have the big contracts or any of that stuff,\u201d second baseman Jason Kipnis said. \u201cBut we have 25 guys who love to compete and have bought into this team. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got.\u201dAs the for the Red Sox, David Ortiz and his teammates are in serious trouble and have to hope they can get things turned around Sunday in Game 3 at Fenway Park or their turnaround season will be over and Big Papi\u2019s career will be done.\u201cBacks against the wall,\u201d manager John Farrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear what lies ahead of us. We go home down 0-2. (Clay) Buchholz on the mound Sunday with an attitude of no tomorrow.\u201dChisenhall connected in the second inning off Price, who fell to 0-8 in nine playoff starts and must now face the wrath of Red Sox Nation. The left-hander lasted just 3 1/3 innings and once again crumbled with a chance to silence critics who say he can\u2019t pitch in the big game.Despite the loss, a defiant Price is convinced he\u2019ll get another chance.\u201cI know my number is going to be called again to pitch another game in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cI want it. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201dThe Indians strung together four straight hits \u2014 three of them soft singles \u2014 to Price in a 4-0 hole after just two innings.That\u2019s all Kluber needed. The Cy Young candidate, who hadn\u2019t pitched since straining his quadriceps on Sept. 26, had little issues with the Red Sox, who missed a chance to do some damage against him in the fourth.Kluber created the jam with two walks before getting Ortiz to swing at the first pitch and pop out. Ortiz slammed his bat to the ground in frustration and Boston\u2019s anxiety grew when Kluber struck out Hanley Ramirez looking for the final out.\u201cWe talked before the game about would he be a little bit rusty or would he be really good,\u201d Indians manager Terry Francona said. \u201cHe answered that question. He was terrific. You go through that lineup and don\u2019t give up runs, you\u2019re pitching.\u201dChisenhall\u2019s start was somewhat of a surprise since he batted just .217 against lefties this season.Francona, however, likes to put his best defense behind Kluber, plus Chisenhall came in batting .364 in his career against Price. The decision paid off in a big way early as Chisenhall\u2019s liner to right in the second gave the Indians a 4-0 lead.As he neared first, Chisenhall raised his arms in triumph. The rest is a blur.\u201cI don\u2019t remember too much running around the bases,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember seeing it go out and I knew it was a home run, so I slowed down pretty quickly. It was a quick run around the bases.\u201dBefore the Indians took the field, James, who led the Cavaliers to the city\u2019s first pro sports championship since 1964 in June, spoke to the crowd.\u201cIt\u2019s always us against the world,\u201d James said.Right now, Cleveland\u2019s on top.BEANTOWN BOUNDIf anyone knows what awaits the Indians, it\u2019s Mike Napoli, who played three seasons in Boston, winning a World Series in 2013.\u201cWe can\u2019t let off the pedal with their type of lineup and their fans,\u201d Napoli said. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to play there. It\u2019s going to be a crazy atmosphere. We need to stick together and keep playing like we know how to.\u201dTRIBE TIDBITSThe Indians have taken a 2-0 lead in the postseason four times. They are 2-1 with the only loss to Boston in the ALDS. \u2026 It was Cleveland\u2019s first postseason shutout since Game 1 of the 2001 ALDS against Seattle. \u2026 Kluber joined Gene Bearden (1948 World Series Game 3) as the only Cleveland pitchers to throw at least seven shutout innings in their postseason debut.UP NEXTRed Sox: Buchholz has had interesting season. He had a 6.35 ERA in his first 10 starts and was demoted to the bullpen. He has tweaked his mechanics and strengthened Farrell\u2019s trust by pitching six innings of one-hit ball in his last regular-season start.Indians: Josh Tomlin lost to the Red Sox on Aug. 15, allowing three runs in 7 2-3 innings.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Game 3 is Sunday night.A reminder, though: Last year, Toronto lost the first two games of the ALDS at home against Texas, then rallied to win the series.Osuna entered after reliever Francisco Liriano was hit in the neck by Carlos Gomez\u2019s line drive. It was Osuna\u2019s first appearance since he left the mound in the AL wild-card win Tuesday night with a shoulder injury, putting his status in doubt.Kevin Pillar, Ezequiel Carrera and Encarnacion, who ended the wild-card game with a three-run homer in the 11th inning, hit solo homers in a five-batter span in the fifth. Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s two-run drive in the second put 20-game winner J.A. Happ and the Blue Jays ahead to stay.Texas scored twice in the eighth, including Gomez\u2019s single that struck Liriano. The pitcher walked off the mound, and an ambulance was waiting to take him to the hospital after the game.A day after Cleveland homered three times in an inning against Boston and won its ALDS opener, the Blue Jays matched the feat on a dreary, misty afternoon in Texas.The home runs boosted the Blue Jays in a game in which they got outhit 13-6.Happ allowed nine hits but only run while pitching into the sixth. The left-hander struck out five and walked one.Darvish had as many strikeouts (four) in his five innings as homers allowed, becoming the first pitcher in the postseason to allow four homers in a game since Minnesota\u2019s Rick Reed against Oakland in Game 3 of the 2002 ALDS.Texas has lost five straight ALDS games to the Blue Jays since winning the first two games in Toronto last October. The Rangers dropped to 1-11 in ALDS games in their home ballpark.Osuna likely came in earlier than manager John Gibbons had planned, a move that followed Liriano getting struck.The ball off Gomez\u2019s bat was measured at 102 mph, and Liriano turned away just in time to avoid being hit in the face. Gomez winced as the ball caromed into right-center field to make it 5-2.Ian Desmond drove in a run with a grounder before Osuna struck out Carlos Beltran to end the eighth.Adrian Beltre was stranded at second after a leadoff double in the ninth.Toronto opened the series with 10-1 win on Thursday, when Cole Hamels gave up seven runs in 3 1-3 innings. It was the worst postseason outing ever for the All-Star lefty who was the MVP of both the World Series and NLCS for Philadelphia in 2008.Pillar started the homer frenzy in the fifth with a leadoff shot, his first drive since June 16 \u2014 a span of 79 games. Carrera hit a one-out shot into the Rangers bullpen in right-center field and Encarnacion hit a ball just over the wall and inside the left-field pole to make it 5-0.After a bases-clearing triple in the opener, Tulowitzki got the Jays started in Game 2 with his homer that made it 2-0. Jose Bautista, 1 for 20 with nine strikeouts in his career against Darvish, had led off the second with a walk.TRAINER\u2019S ROOMBlue Jays: 2B Devon Travis was scratched from the starting lineup about an hour before first pitch because of right knee irritation.Rangers: RF Shin-Soo Choo was out of the lineup after playing Game 1, but manager Jeff Banister said Choo was fine physically. Choo was on the disabled list four times this year, and had missed 39 games with a broken left forearm until last weekend.UP NEXTBlue Jays: One of the two losses by RHP Aaron Sanchez was to Texas, when he gave up a season high-matching six runs and was the loser in that May 15 game with the bench-clearing brawl after Bautista was punched by Rougned Odor.Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis, who starts game 3, is 4-1 with a 2.38 ERA in nine career postseason games (eight starts) for Texas.

Firstly, ratings have been tumbling week over week and now another metric to measure the effect has appeared as TV networks have now been forced to begin giving money back to advertisers because not as many people are watching football to be exposed to their TV commercials.The networks have been providing advertisers with what are termed \u201cmake-goods.\u201d These are refunds given to advertisers because the cost of advertising is predicated on the number of viewers a TV commercial will reach during a pro football game. But with ratings falling, often by double digits, advertisers are demanding their \u201cmake-goods\u201d because ads are hitting far fewer eyes than they paid for.Some are already calling these make-goods the \u201cKaepernick effect\u201d\u00a0with advertising revenues taking a major hit as fans tune out in droves.According to Sporting News, TV ads during pro football games can cost between $500,000 and $600,000 per 30-second spot. But advertisers are sold on these exorbitant costs on the assumption that their ads will be included in games reaching far above a 20 Neilsen TV rating.Unfortunately for advertisers, the networks and the NFL, ratings have tumbled to less than a 15 rating and in the case of the September 26 broadcast of Monday Night Football the game only earned a 5.7 rating. The latter was a 38 percent drop over the same week\u2019s game in 2015.This means millions of people are no longer being reached by the commercials advertisers are paying up to $600,000 to air.Meanwhile, a new Rasmussen poll finds that 32 percent of adults surveyed say that they have stopped watching NFL football because of the protests while only a scant 13 percent said they are more likely to tune in because of the anthem protests.The poll further found\u00a0that more women than men are tired of the Black Lives Matter-like protests with 29 percent of men saying they are less likely to watch pro football compared to 38 percent of women who intimated that they are uncomfortable with the protests.There is plenty of blame to go around, it appears. Sports commentator Jason Whitlock, for one, is laying some of the blame on the left-wingers infesting the sports media complex for pushing lefty causes at the expense of sports..@WhitlockJason blames progressive sports media for undermining interest in sports and the NFL rating decline. pic.twitter.com/XqAcqYEOq9\u2014 Speak For Yourself (@SFY) October 5, 2016At least one other factor has been affecting viewership on the broadcast networks. Neither Peyton Manning (retired) nor Tom Brady (suspended) played during the league\u2019s first four weeks. The NFL has been increasing its presence online and the number of people watching games over Internet services are having a thus far undetermined affect on TV viewing.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Breitbart Sports, Colin Kaepernick, NFLComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The angry white male Trump voter wants his country back. The angry white male Trump voter, to use their lunatic candidate\u2019s meaningless phrases, wants to \u2018win.\u2019 And to \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019Enough.The angry white male Trump voters are not the only angry Americans right now, in fact they are not alone, they are not the majority, and they are not even the angriest.It is time for the media, for the Mussolini-in-makeup Trump, for the world to recognize that real Americans, liberals and conservatives driven together in common defense of this nation, real Americans, the ones who believe in democracy, diversity, and innocence-until-proven guilty\u2026 we are angry too.We have had enough of what this man, Trump, has made us look like to the world.We have had enough of the hatreds he has unleashed. And the apologists in the media who have not stood up and called him what he is: A fascist who wants to end this democracy.We have had enough of every third thing coming out of his mouth serving the goals of the terrorists, like ISIS. And the rogue nations like Russia.We have had enough of every lie and excuse and contradiction and him saying he was smart and brilliant not to pay taxes, then his son insisting\u00a0he has paid taxes, then his spokesman refusing to say either way.We have had enough of the constant whining and bleating about how everything has been fixed and rigged against this man, to whom the difficulties of inheriting a fortune and a business are the equivalent of the endless punishment of bigotry against African-Americans. To whom giving money to his employees is as big a sacrifice as a mother and father losing their son in war, to whom the dating scene of the 1970s was his Vietnam.We have had enough of the casual cruelties and the unthinking dolts who applaud them. The boasts after the dead in Orlando, or on the streets of Chicago, or of the discovery of bombs in New York.We have had enough of the attacks on every journalist, every columnist, every news organization \u2013unless their news organization has recently run a poll favorable to him.(h/t RCP Video)Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Breitbart Sports, Breitbart TV, Donald Trump, GQ Magazine, Keith OlbermannComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Florida rejected the idea of playing a home game away at Baton Rouge, citing difficulties in traveling.Although Hurricane Matthew killed several hundred people in Haiti, its arrival in Florida did not match its hype. The hurricane hit further up the Atlantic Coast than anticipated and received a downgrading to a Category Three storm. Still, strong winds and rains pounded coastal areas, and hundreds of thousands lost power.Major obstacles stand in the way of rescheduling. The teams\u2019 bye weeks, for instance, don\u2019t match.

Marlow7 Oct 20160In an interview for the November issue of Golf Digest, Parnevik said that the 14-time major champion has been \u201chitting a lot of balls, and he\u2019s hitting it great. He\u2019s pounding it a mile and flushing everything,\u201dParnevik, who spent some time watching Tiger hit balls at the range and played nine holes with him at the Medalist Golf Club in Florida, said, \u201cOn the range, at least, his trajectory and ball flight are like the Tiger we knew 15 years ago. Comebacks are never a sure thing, but something tells me his might be spectacular.\u201d The 51-year-old Swedish golfer and Woods have patched things up since their falling out several years ago over Woods\u2019 treatment of his former wife Elin Nordegren. Parnevik introduced Nordegren to Woods when she served as an au pair for Parnevik\u2019s children.Parnevik told GD that he felt betrayed by Tiger when he engaged in extra-marital affairs. \u201cWhen the infidelity came to light, it felt like the worst betrayal ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut over time, I forgave Tiger. He and Elin are friends, which is nice, and he\u2019s a good parent. His mistakes hurt him, too.\u201dWoods, who dominated golf for well over a decade commanding 683 weeks as world No 1, (now ranked 767), has not teed-it-up since August 2015, when he competed at the Wyndham Championship and finished tied for 10th place. After that, Tiger stopped playing and underwent two back surgeries. In September 2015 he had surgery to remove a disc fragment that was pinching a nerve and a month later he had a second surgery to treat a different pinched nerve in his back.\u00a0Woods endured a prior back surgery in 2014 and has had multiple surgeries on his left knee starting in 2008, the year that Woods last won a major tournament.\u00a0Tiger\u2019s former Stanford roommate and longtime friend Notah Begay said last month that he believes this will be Woods\u2019 last attempt to come back from his injuries. \u201cIt will be a new chapter,\u201d said Begay, a former PGA pro who currently serves as an analyst for the Golf Channel. \u201cJust like 1996 was the beginning, this is going to be the beginning of a new chapter for Tiger Woods, and probably his last. He understands that he\u2019s much closer to the end of his career than the beginning and that if he has another injury and has to sustain another rehabilitation period that he might not make it back.\u201dBreitbart Sports, Jesper Parnevik, Safeway Open, Tiger WoodComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He had an RBI single in Toronto\u2019s five-run third off All-Star left-hander Cole Hamels.Bautista added a 425-foot blast in the ninth inning, and the Blue Jays slugger seemed to deliberately drop the bat softly near home plate after his second homer of this postseason.Troy Tulowitzki hit a bases-loaded triple for the Blue Jays. Toronto has won four straight overall, including an 11-inning, 5-2 victory over Baltimore in the AL wild-card game Tuesday night.Estrada, also an All-Star pitcher this season, limited Texas to four hits, the last Elvis Andrus\u2019 leadoff triple in the ninth. Manager John Gibbons removed the right-hander after Shin-Soo Choo\u2019s RBI grounder ended the shutout bid.Estrada has never pitched a complete game in the majors and the Blue Jays didn\u2019t throw one this season. No matter, Estrada gave them all they needed to start this best-of-five series.Toronto had to win its last two regular-season games at AL East champion Boston just to make the playoffs. The Blue Jays then won at home this week when Edwin Encarnacion hit a game-ending, three-run homer to beat Baltimore.Bautista was booed heartily during pregame introductions and while he batted in the first inning. There also were chants of \u201cRougie! Rougie!\u201d \u2014 those were for Rougned Odor, the second baseman who punched Bautista and ignited a bench-clearing brawl in their last meeting May 15. Odor was suspended seven games.By time Bautista led off the seventh with a walk, the ballpark was quiet with the Rangers down 7-0. After he homered, a fan threw the ball almost back to the infield.The only hit Estrada allowed in the first six innings came when Adrian Beltre led off the second with a soft grounder to the right side of the infield, when the pitcher didn\u2019t get over to cover the base.Texas didn\u2019t have another hit until Carlos Beltran singled in the seventh, but was promptly erased by a double play.Hamels, the MVP of the 2008 World Series and NLCS for Philadelphia, threw 42 of his 82 pitches in the third. He allowed seven runs (six earned) with three walks in 3 1/3 innings.Ezequiel Carrera was on second base with two outs in the third when Josh Donaldson hit a liner toward base. Donaldson had even stopped running, assuming that Beltre would catch the ball \u2014 instead, the rising liner ricocheted off the mitt of the four-time Gold Glover and into left field for an RBI double that made it 1-0.Encarnacion then had a single on a liner off Hamels\u2019 outstretched glove, before Bautista\u2019s run-scoring single and Russell Martin\u2019s walk to load the bases.Tulowitzki followed with a triple deep into the right-center gap on a ball that All-Star center fielder Ian Desmond might have lost when running out of the sun and into the shadows while getting close to the wall during the late afternoon.Melvin Upton Jr. homered starting the Toronto sixth before Andrus\u2019 one-out throwing error from shortstop allowed leadoff hitter Devon Travis to reach.Donaldson, who had four hits and walked, then had an RBI double to chase Hamels. Alex Claudio then pitched 3 2-3 scoreless innings.When Texas had errors on three consecutive plays in that shaky seventh inning of Game 5 last October, leading up to Bautista\u2019s homer, Andrus had two of them. Andrus had misplayed a grounder to start that frame, and dropped an easy toss on what would have been a sure force out.TRAINER\u2019S ROOMBlue Jays: Closer Roberto Osuna came out of the AL wild-card with shoulder soreness, and it was never clear beforehand if the right-hander was available for the ALDS opener. He was never needed. \u201cIf not today, there should be no limitations (Friday),\u201d manager John Gibbons said before the game.Rangers: Choo was on the postseason roster, batting ninth in the opener and went 0 for 3. He had four stints on the disabled list this season, and had missed 39 games with a fractured left forearm before returning for the last three games of the regular season.UP NEXTBlue Jays: LHP J.A. Happ, a 20-game winner, allowed one run in seven innings in a win against the Rangers on May 5. He stars Friday afternoon at Texas.Rangers: Yu Darvish starts only his second postseason game in his five seasons with Texas. The right-hander from Japan lost the 2012 AL wild-card game against Baltimore, and missed last season after Tommy John surgery.Breitbart Sports, Breitbart TexasComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Well, one clue in a new poll indicates that one-third of viewers are changing the channel over the anti-American protests during the national anthem.A new Rasmussen poll finds that 32 percent of adults surveyed say that they have stopped watching NFL football because of the protests while only a scant 13 percent said they are more likely to tune in because of the anthem protests.Drilling down into the results shows that more women than men are tired of the Black Lives Matter-like protests with 29 percent of men saying they are less likely to watch pro\u00a0football\u00a0compared to 38 percent of women, who intimated that they are uncomfortable with the protests.The NFL preseason kicked off in controversy when San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to remain seated during the playing of the national anthem instead of standing in honor of the nation\u2019s theme like everyone else was.As the weeks rolled on and Kaepernick began kneeling on the field during the regular season,\u00a0his protest spread not only throughout the NFL but into other sports.As the season rolls into Week Five, though, television ratings have been seen tumbling each week to new lows.The ratings for Week Three\u2019s Sunday featured game between Chicago and Dallas measured in at 12.9 in the Neilsen ratings. This is down from the previous Sunday\u2019s 13.7 and that was down from week one\u2019s 13.9 rating. Ratings also dropped by 18 percent over week three from last year for all the midday regional games, according to Sports Business Daily.The ratings for Monday Night Football are\u00a0even worse. The game between Atlanta and New Orleans received a low 5.7 rating. It was a 38 percent plunge over the same week last year.During these protests, Colin Kaepernick\u2019s reputation has also taken a major hit. Since he started his rants against America, he has become the most hated player in the NFL.Despite that, Kaepernick has continued his anti-American attacks even off the field. Recently he attacked the U.S. saying it has never been great as he talked about Donald Trump\u2019s now well-loved slogan.\u201cHe always says, \u2018Make America great again,'\u201d Kaepernick said\u00a0about Trump.\u00a0\u201cWell, America has never been great for people of color and that\u2019s something that needs to be addressed. Let\u2019s make America great for the first time.\u201dKaepernick\u2019s hate for the country has spread to other sports, and even high schools, have begun indulging these protests. And just last weekend a college marching band drew criticism from its own school administrators for taking a knee during the national anthem.But, if the news on the ratings are any indication, Americans are beginning to get fed up with the constant drumbeat of liberal politics shoehorned into their once beloved forms of apolitical entertainment.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Breitbart Sports, Colin Kaepernick, National Anthem, NFLComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Ryan (R.-Wis.), when Ryan said he would not defend or campaign with Trump.On the call, Ryan told the congressmen to look out for themselves and not to feel loyalty to Trump.The combat veteran of the war in Iraq, who was the acting commander of more than 3,000 special operations personnel at\u00a0Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force\u2013Arabian Peninsula, said he knew nothing whatsoever about plans\u00a0rumored to have been originated with the speaker\u00a0replace Trump from the top of the ticket with Indiana Gov. Michael Pence, who is Trump\u2019s vice-presidential running mate.Although, Zinke said he still supports Trump, he understands members of Congress, who feel they have to represent their own districts.\u201cSometimes representing your district is more important that representing your party,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIn Montana, Trump won soundly, but so did Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said.\u00a0The Treasure State primary was held June 7 with Trump taking 74 percent of the vote.

Harwood did not ask about Clinton\u2019s emails.Other emails, including an invitation for lunch, appear more innocuous. Some look simply like pitches for interviews. Regardless, they reveal a close relationship between Harwood and Podesta \u2014 and apparent political support from Harwood.On Jan. 28, 2016, for example, Harwood emailed\u00a0Podesta to report that Clinton had done well at an event in Iowa: \u201cShe was good here in Newton.\u201dAnd on\u00a0March 14, 2016, Harwood emailed Podesta: \u201chow are you feeling about tomorrow?\u201d The next day, March 15, was an important Democratic primary day, when Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and North Carolina voted.Clinton won all five contests \u2014 though by a narrow margin in Missouri and Illinois Harwood wrote again to Podesta: \u201cCongrats \u2013 pretty strong.\u201d Podesta then replied to Harwood in the early hours of March 16: \u201cYup. Feeling good.\u201dRevelations from the Wikileaks email dump are ongoing \u2014 though the media have shown a curious reluctance to highlight them, focusing instead on leaked video of Donald Trump joking about groping women in 2005.Joel B.

I think it is the case that folks in leadership, whether it\u2019s in business or in civil society, or in politics, make slightly different arguments, nuanced arguments to different audiences, when they\u2019re pursuing a laudable public goal, but it\u2019s important to stick to the same principle, even when making different arguments.\u201dHe was then asked, \u201cSo, let\u2019s say the context of those comments would clarify things from her perspective. Why doesn\u2019t she simply release the full transcripts from those Wall Street speeches?\u201dCoons answered, \u201cThat\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t know where these transcripts have been coming from. As I think was mentioned last night in the debate in St. Louis, there\u2019s a real question about the origin of everything that\u2019s being leaked at the moment. The leaders of our intelligence community have suggested that the Russians, who have hacked into a variety of different systems, are selectively leaking them to influence our own elections.\u201dHe added, \u201cWell, it would seem to me that it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest for us to reach across the aisle, to engage those who feel they\u2019re on the outside, to build some confidence in, I think, the strongest candidate for president, Secretary Clinton, and to release things that are now only known in portion.\u201d(h/t Grabien)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton, Chris Coons, Hillary Clinton Wall Street speeches, wall streetComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Eleven hours. I was kind of expecting around hour #8 Bernie Sanders would burst in and shout \u2013 \u201cenough about your damn emails Hillary!!\u201dPodesta advised them to steer away from email jokes.\u201cI defer if others think this buys us good will with Sanders people, but email jokes in Iowa usually end up badly and don\u2019t we want to move on?\u201d he wrote. (It\u2019s possible that Podesta was referring to Clinton\u2019s widely criticized Snapchat joke about her emails at the Iowa Wing Ding dinner.)Hillary Campaign manager Robby Mook also had a suggestion.\u201cIs there some Apprentice joke to make? I never saw the show,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also the worst person to generate jokes.\u201dIt appears that Palmieri enjoyed\u00a0the thought of a good email joke, suggesting another one\u00a0during a March, 2015 email to discuss a speech to Emily\u2019s List.\u201cI wanted to float idea of HRC making a joke about the email situation at the Emily\u2019s List dinner tonight.

The first question is framed by crediting Clinton with coming within a \u201cwhisker from a Middle East peace deal.\u201d Three of the questions are followed by proposed answers in all CAPS from the Clinton Foundation.* At the very end of your presidency, it seemed that you came a whisker from a Middle East peace deal, and the Clinton parameters are still generally acknowledged to be the basis of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal if it comes. But will it ever come? Aren\u2019t demographics and the growth of settlements making it harder to see a two -state solution emerging any time soon?* For most of human history, China has been the dominant power in the world. We just happen to live in a relatively brief 300-year stretch when China was weak. But is China regaining its customary position as the dominant power in the world today, and should that worry us? Should we just get used to it? And given that China is our creditor, where do we find leverage to change Chinese behavior, whether on Tibet or Taiwan or human rights or trade?1.

For voters, Clinton has embraced the rhetoric of a class warrior: Higher taxes on the wealthy. Tougher rules for Wall Street. Empathy for the financial burdens of ordinary Americans.The gap between her private and public remarks helps explain the relatively high levels of distrust that voters, including some of her own supporters, have expressed about the former secretary of state, New York senator and presidential spouse. Privately, to audiences at Goldman Sachs and others, Clinton expressed a philosophy that in some ways clashes with the progressive vision she has articulated while campaigning.Here\u2019s a breakdown of the differences:\u2014WALL STREETIn public, Clinton has taken a hard tack toward Wall Street, opposing any weakening of the regulatory reforms passed after the 2008 financial meltdown. She has warned that Republican lawmakers and Donald Trump want to abolish the stricter rules imposed under the Dodd-Frank law enacted in 2010.\u201cWe should extend the rules passed in Dodd-Frank on Wall Street in crisis and strengthen them both for the big banks and the shadow banking system,\u201d Clinton said in a speech in North Carolina this summer. \u201cAnd I will veto any reforms to repeal those rules and vigorously enforce the law with accountability so Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again.\u201dYet fears have lingered that despite such proclamations, Clinton remains too cozy with major banks and investment funds. The financial sector has been a major source of campaign donations for Clinton. And in a paid speech for a Goldman Sachs symposium in 2013, Clinton suggested that the industry should play a dominant hand in developing its own rules\u201cThere\u2019s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad,\u201d she is quoted as saying in the hacked emails. \u201cHow do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.\u201dMany experts agree that the financial industry itself needs to have some voice in crafting regulations, if new rules are to be effective and provide safety without sacrificing economic growth. But the emphasis in her private speech was much more sympathetic to the financial sector than what some industry watchdogs would wish.\u2014THE MIDDLE CLASSClinton routinely celebrates her connection to average Americans.\u201cMy mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top,\u201d she said in an August speech. \u201cThis is personal for me. I am a product of the American middle class\u2026. I\u2019ve always remembered that I\u2019m the daughter of a small-business owner and the granddaughter of a factory worker \u2013 and proud of both.\u201dYet despite the vast financial riches that she and her husband, Bill, began reaping once he left the presidency in 2001, Clinton even seemed to suggest that they face the same struggles with debt and college costs that many American households do.\u201cWe came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,\u201d Clinton told ABC News in 2014. \u201cWe had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea\u2019s education.\u201dThe Clintons are now worth several tens of millions of dollars, collected from speeches, book deals and other business arrangements. She seldom highlights this wealth in campaign addresses.But she did so in a 2014 speech for Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, the investment management company. Speaking in private, Clinton acknowledged being increasingly isolated from the financial struggles of much of the country, saying, instead, that memories of her middle class past are her primary connection now.\u201cObviously, I\u2019m kind of far removed because the life I\u2019ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy,\u201d she said.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, emails, Hillary Clinton, The middle class, wall streetComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It was a strategy he raised in his taped apology, posted hours after Friday\u2019s leak of the video from 2005 that has rocked his campaign and caused dozens of Republican lawmakers to abandon their support of his candidacy.Trump refused to take questions when he appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey at the St. Louis hotel where he was preparing for the debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. The meeting was posted on his Facebook page. The four women also were invited by Trump to watch the debate inside the debate hall.\u201cMr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me,\u201d Broaddrick said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any comparison.\u201dBroaddrick, a former Arkansas nursing home administrator, first claimed 17 years ago that Bill Clinton raped her during a meeting in Little Rock in 1978. She sued Bill Clinton in 1999; the case was dismissed in 2001. A Twitter account that claimed to be that of Broaddrick revived the allegations on Saturday and was retweeted by Trump. Bill Clinton has long denied her account.Jones, a former Arkansas state worker, alleged in 1991 that Bill Clinton propositioned and exposed himself to her. In 1994, she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. Bill Clinton\u2019s lawyers tried to have the suit dismissed. In November 1998, he paid Jones $850,000 to settle the case without apologizing or acknowledging culpability.\u201cI think they should all look at the fact that (Trump) is a good person,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s not what other people have been saying he\u2019s been, like Hillary. He\u2019s going to make America great again.\u201dWilley, a former White House volunteer, is using a website to again accuse Bill Clinton of forcing himself on her in 1993. He denied her charge and an independent prosecutor later concluded there was no evidence to doubt that denial.Kathy Shelton, a fourth woman who appeared with Trump at the hotel conference room, was an Arkansas sexual assault victim whose assailant was defended by Hillary Clinton.In 1975, at age 12, Shelton was sexually assaulted in northwest Arkansas. Clinton was asked by a judge overseeing the case to represent Shelton\u2019s alleged attacker. After the prosecution lost key evidence, Clinton\u2019s client entered a plea to a lesser charge. In an interview a decade later, Clinton expressed horror at the crime, but was recorded on tape laughing about procedural details of the case. The audio has been seized on by conservative groups looking to attack Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy.On Friday, The Washington Post and NBC released a video of Trump, unaware he was on a hot microphone, suggesting that he forced himself on women to \u201cgrab them by the p\u2014-\u201d and that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.

When they see hatred going on, they have to report it,\u201d Trump said.The questioner did not refer to Americans being killed in terror attacks, but suggested that Muslims are indirect victims of the jihad attacks.\u00a0\u201cWith Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\u201d the questioner said.\u00a0There were no warnings about numerous pending Islamic attacks, including the Boston bombings, the 2015 San Bernardino attack and the recent bombings in New Jersey, despite evidence of extensive preparations.In his response to the question, Trump cited the San Bernardino attack:In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.In her response to the same question, Hillary Clinton criticized Trump for his insistence on greater cooperation from Muslims, and she\u00a0downplayed the question of whether Muslims should do more to alert police when fellow Muslims are preparing to killed Americans. It\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims,\u201d she said.  We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see. Clinton also insisted there\u2019s no conflict between Islam and the non-Islamic West, despite the statements by Islamic attackers that they\u2019re motivated by Islam. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.Under President Barack Obama, various Islamic political groups have opposed bipartisan demands for cooperation, and have successfully lobbied for restrictions on FBI investigations. These groups have also successfully pushed the establishment media to use the term, \u201cIslamophobia\u201d which suggests that Americans\u2019 reaction to terror attacks\u00a0is excessive. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, jihad, terrorismComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Spring and fall 2007 polls showed Clinton enjoying a substantial, double-digit lead, according to Real Clear Politics. A Denver Post survey conducted shortly before the caucus showed a two-point edge favoring Senator Obama, however. The New York Times would later report that Obama was victorious by a 2-to-1 margin, enjoying 67 percent support compared to Clinton\u2019s 32.The leaked Podesta email does not offer any additional basis for their concerns apart from the assertions of trusted Clinton confidants.Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 rhetoric with respect to election integrity concerns has been largely in-step with the Democrat Party line that voter fraud is an imaginary menace and any attempt to combat it otherwise should be seen as a \u201cblast from a Jim Crow past\u201d. During a January 2016 speech dedicated to \u201cvoting rights\u201d in Houston, Texas, she called on proponents of voter ID and similar policies \u201cto stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they\u2019re so scared of letting citizens have their say.\u201dOf additional note is the inclusion of Mr. Elias and his tasking to help prevent \u201cineligible voters\u201d from possibly stealing Colorado and others from Clinton again. One month after the email was apparently sent, the Clinton election attorney would receive considerable recognition from The New York Times and others for accepting $5 million direct from progressive financier George Soros to attack voter ID and other election integrity reforms in multiple states. Proponents of such reforms argue that the laws are designed to keep ineligible ballots from being cast at the polling place.Logan Churchwell is the Assistant Editor and a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.

For a guy like Mr. Trump, there is no more terrifying threat. And for the good of American industry and freedom \u2014 as well as rich people like Mr. Trump \u2014 that should keep him up at night and laser-focused on winning this election.In Sunday night\u2019s debate, Mr. Trump raised the stakes to similar levels for\u00a0Mrs. Clinton. If elected, he said, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her disastrous and reckless handling of classified emails as secretary of state.Just when you thought this campaign could not get any wilder.Mutual.Assured.Destruction.Then Mr. Trump punctuated the threat as Mrs. Clinton prattled on about how unfit the real estate mogul is to hold the office she so desperately wants.\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good,\u201d she sing-songed, \u201cthat someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country \u2014\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Trump interjected with a vicious spear.Not since Daniel entered the lion\u2019s den has any mortal walked into a room with a fierce political machine and a monolithic media more resolutely against him.Teeth bared. Drooling. Pawing at the ground as they circled him, smelling the blood coming out of his wherever from the wound caused by a nasty vulgar tape from a hot mic 11 years ago of the real estate mogul talking about scoring women.Seriously, you have a billionaire who cuts deals with the richest and nastiest titans of Wall Street and New York real estate and talks in vile terms about bedding women, and this is a surprise to someone? Did any of these vultures watch the movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d?This same guy builds monumental phallic edifices emblazoned with his name in giant gold letters and flies big jets with his name down the side, and these people are shocked to learn he is capable of crudeness and bravado? TRIGGER WARNING: They guy loves beauty pageants so much he has actually owned them!At the time of the recording, Mr. Trump was guest starring in a soap opera, promoting a show that was in itself a shameless promotion for his own \u201creality\u201d show and these people are shocked to hear Mr. Trump bragging about his prowess in the sack and his ability to command desirous women?Seriously, these people lead sadly sheltered lives.And then THEY complain that it\u2019s all not suitable for children, yet THEY are the ones who brought it up and will not stop talking about it?The release of this decade-old tape, of course, was perfectly calculated between the Clinton campaign and the shameless media to extinguish any hopes of a Trump resurgence in Sunday night\u2019s debate.Well, they better hope that tape kills him. Because the Donald Trump that showed up for Sunday night\u2019s debate utterly destroyed Hillary Clinton.The Donald Trump that showed up for this debate could win this election in a walk.

Mr. Kassam talked about how Carswell has isolated himself from much of the rest of the regular membership of the party and his multiple instances of criticizing his own party leadership and its members.Kassam set down some ground rules in order for the MP to stay in the party saying that Mr. Carswell \u201cbehaved very badly now for several years,\u201d \u00a0and spoke directly to the MP saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t appear to have had the party\u2019s interests at heart. Your local branch is falling apart.\u201dOne tweet from Mr Carswell in particular caught the ire of Kassam. Carswell tweeted that the U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump had gone \u201cThanet South,\u201d an allusion to the last British general election. Then UKIP leader Nigel Farage had run in the constituency of South Thanet, and did not win, though there were several reports\u00a0of dubious activities after the result.It's all going a bit South Thanet for the US Republicans, I see?   https://t.co/dYER2GLCAI\u2014 Douglas Carswell MP (@DouglasCarswell) August 24, 2016One of the biggest problems for Kassam is the control Carswell has over the \u201cshort money\u201d \u2013 tax payer funding which Carswell receives for being a member of parliament in an opposition party. According to Kassam the money would be better spent by giving it over to the central party who could then employ their own researchers in London and helping branches across the country, rather than Carswell monopolizing it and using his own research team.The composition of Carswell\u2019s research team is also a hot issue for Kassam who accuses Carswell of using Conservative Party members in his team, rather than solely researchers from UKIP.The next ground rule laid down by Kassam was the need for Carswell to publicly apologise for his treatment of members of UKIP including the leadership and the supporters. Carswell has been a constant critic of the UKIP leadership of Nigel Farage and speculation has led some to believe that his actions were part of a plot\u00a0to \u201cneutralise\u201d the growing popularity of Mr. Farage.The final rule mentioned by Kassam was a contract that Carswell must sign indicating that he was\u00a0never to engage in negativity toward his own\u00a0political party or its members, supporters and officials ever again. \u201cAnd if you break the contract, Douglas\u2026 bye bye,\u201d Kassam said.Many live stream followers indicated that Mr. Carswell was unlikely to do any of these things, a point which Kassam stressed would therefore be grounds enough for his explusion.The ground rules follow on the comments\u00a0by Kassam last week on CNN in which he said that it was time for UKIP to \u201cgrow up\u201d as a party. He described the propositions to solve the problem with Carswell by saying he was only, \u201cputting in basic ground rules like grown ups do.\u201dBreitbart editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam announced after the sudden resignation of UKIP leader Diane James that he would run for the leadership of the party under the slogan \u201cMake UKIP great again.\u201d Kassam wants to see more direct democracy within the party who he says need to take over the opposition spot from the Labour Party who are losing much of their traditional working class voter base in the aftermath of Brexit.Breitbart London, UKIP, douglas carswell, raheem kassam, ukip, UKIP leadership contestComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Yet not doing so would undermine the claim that leaving the EU would enable Britain to take back control of her borders.To get around the problem, Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has suggested that Britain could work with Ireland to strengthen her external borders to combat illegal immigration once Britain withdraws from the EU. The two countries already collect passenger information from those passing through customs; it is envisaged that the information would be shared freely between the two.Speaking to The Guardian, he said \u201cWe have put in place a range of measures to further combat illegal migration working closely with the Irish government.\u201cOur focus is to strengthen the external border of the common travel area, building on the strong collaboration with our Irish partners.\u201dThere is a precedent for the two counties working together on immigration: currently, the citizens of 16 countries including China and India can apply for a visa which grants them access to both countries. It has been suggested that this could be extended.Mr. Brokenshire said: \u201cWe are already working closely with the Irish government and other members of the common travel area to prevent people from seeking to evade UK immigration controls from entering via another part of the CTA.\u201cThere is a high level of collaboration on a joint programme of work. This includes investment in border procedures; increased data sharing to inform immigration and border security decisions; passenger data systems enabling the collection and processing of advance passenger information; and harmonised visa processes.\u201dThe scheme would leave the UK vulnerable to EU immigration as EU citizens would still have the right to travel freely into Ireland to live and work if they so wished. This raises the possibility of EU citizens using Ireland as a springboard to move to the UK.But Dan Mulhall, the Irish ambassador to Britain, has dismissed this as an issue. He recently told the House of Lords: \u201cFor as long as Ireland is not part of Schengen [The EU\u2019s borderless zone], everyone coming into Ireland from continental Europe and beyond has to go through passport control at our airports and ports.\u201cTherefore, the only people who will have the right of free movement into Ireland and the right to live, work, visit and settle in Ireland will be European Union citizens.\u201cIt is, of course, true that an EU citizen could come to Ireland after Brexit, settle in Ireland and then decide to go across the border to Northern Ireland and then to Britain, but they would be illegal immigrants. As I understand, most Europeans are not interested in being illegal in any European country It seems to me that only a relatively small number of European Union citizens would want to come to the UK illegally.\u201dA spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May commented: \u201cThe open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has undoubtedly served both people and businesses extremely well.\u201cThere is a very strong commitment between the UK government and the Northern Ireland executive to see that remains the case, that there is no return to the borders of the past.\u201cWork is ongoing to strengthen that relationship in the future.\u201dBreitbart London, border control, Brexit, free movement of people, Good Friday Agreement, Ireland, ShengenComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The camp is due for demolition in the next few weeks.Speaking to KentOnline, Mr. Burton recounted: \u201cWe take our staff and friends on a day trip across the Channel, to Bruges or Belgium or France, often a few times a year.\u201cIt was a great day out until we started our return journey to Calais.\u201cWe were about a mile from the port at about 9pm and the road was suddenly blocked by a load of people with hoods and covered faces. I have no doubt that they were refugees.\u201cThey were banging on the windows, hitting the car and trying to get in, shouting and screaming at us.\u201cLisa was driving and she was blowing on her horn and driving slowly through, but who knows what would have happened if she had stopped.\u201dWhen Mr. Burton approached French Border Control to report the incident, they shrugged it off, saying that such incidents were not uncommon. They said that many go unreported\u00a0and that a coach recently had all its windows smashed out.\u201cObviously it would be different if something like this happened here, someone would be arrested, but we have decided not to take it any further because it was on French soil and we are not sure what police would do anyway,\u201d Mr. Burton added.\u201cThe situation in Calais is clearly completely out of control.\u201cWe often go over to France on the ferry, two or three times a year, and we know a lot of others who do the same, but now we have seen what can happen on the other side, we will think twice before going back, and we hope others do too.\u201dMrs. Burton added that she had been terrified by the events, and has vowed not to return to France again until the situation is remedied.\u201cWe all just gasped as soon as we saw the group and some of the older ones in the car were really upset as it was terrifying,\u201d she said.\u201cI don\u2019t know what they thought they could achieve by acting in this way. They are desperate, I know, and maybe angry that we could get to England so easy and they couldn\u2019t but why did they think that by attacking and scaring us, this could help them?\u201cWe won\u2019t be returning until we know we are safe to travel around Calais and we want people to be aware of the situation. Imagine if we had children in the car?\u201cThe ferry may be cheap at \u00a319 a crossing, but it\u2019s not worth it when you are at risk of this.\u201dThe incident is merely the latest in a string of attacks on vehicles passing through Calais. Locals have been warning each other to avoid certain roads after migrants amused themselves by smashing up vehicles waiting in traffic, while truck drivers have repeatedly warned of the danger they face from migrants attempting to board their lorries.On Sunday an Eritrean man was killed while attempting to block the A16 road near Calais in order to slow traffic.

Last month, the popular right-wing Pepe the Frog meme was added to the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Hate Symbol Database, opening the way for its use to be classed as a hate crime.The UK guidelines also specifies that \u201cthose who encourage others to commit a communications offence may be charged: for instance, encouragement to tweet or re-tweet a grossly offensive message, or the creation of a derogatory hashtag, or making available personal information (doxing), so that individuals can more easily be targeted by others\u201d.Adding: \u201cSuch encouragement may sometimes lead to a campaign of harassment or \u2018virtual mobbing\u2019 or \u2018dog-piling\u2019, whereby a number of individuals use social media or messaging to disparage another person, usually because they are opposed to that person\u2019s opinions.\u201dAny \u201ccommunications which\u2026 may be considered grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false\u201d will be criminalised under Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988, it is stated. The maximum sentence for the social media offences is 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, although this can rise if there is evidence of threatening behaviour.The Malicious Communications Act has already been used to jail teenagers for posting offensive messages on Facebook. In another notorious case, a man was put on trial under the Act after he posted a joke bomb threat on Twitter.The new guidelines acknowledge that protecting free speech and jokes, and avoiding abuses of the laws to silence debate, is an issue.The document says comments have to pass a \u201chigh threshold\u201d and police should not prosecute people for comments which are considered \u201csatirical\u201d or \u201cbanter and humour\u201d.The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Alison Saunders, commented: \u201cSocial media can be used to educate, entertain and enlighten but there are also people who use it to bully, intimidate and harass.\u201cIgnorance is not a defence and perceived anonymity is not an escape. Those who commit these acts, or encourage others to do the same, can and will be prosecuted.\u201dMrs. Saunders also boasted: \u201cOur latest Hate Crime Report showed that in 2015-16 more hate crime prosecutions were completed than ever before. More than four in five prosecuted hate crimes result in a conviction; with over 73 per cent guilty pleas.\u201dIn August, it was reported that the London Mayor had set up a new police \u201chate crime hub\u201d staffed by \u201ca dedicated police team\u201d backed by \u201cvolunteers\u201d who will monitor social media full time for so-called \u201chate crimes\u201d and \u201ctrolls\u201d to criminalise.Breitbart London, Alison Saunders, cencorship, Doxing, facebook, free speech, hate speech, internet trolling, Social Media, TwitterComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

That\u2019s because, though I had heard her red-meat opening speech in which she promised to deliver us the \u201cFull\u00a0English Brexit not\u00a0the Continental croissants-and-coffee version\u201d (as my colleague Charles Moore\u00a0so brilliantly put it), what I hadn\u2019t heard were all the subsequent speeches in which she and her senior cabinet colleagues outlined their plans to turn Britain into a fiscally reckless, micromanagerial, inward-looking Big Government paradigm, rather than the free-booting, small state, outward looking trading state some of us had dearly hoped it might be. More on this in another column.One quick final thought though: that awful speech by Amber Rudd \u2013 even after you\u2019ve pinched yourself, really hard, you\u2019ll find to your amazement that she still holds the office of Home Secretary \u2013 where she announced plans to name and shame\u00a0any British companies that employed too many foreign workers, earning comparisons with Mein Kampf.Was there ever a public statement better calculated to make Britain\u2019s exit from the EU as unpleasant, heavily-resisted and difficult as possible?

Police fired a warning shot but were unable to stop him.German media have reported that Albakr is believed to be connected to Islamic extremist groups, but Saxony police have not commented on his possible motive or the bomb plot\u2019s target.The explosives were destroyed Saturday in a controlled detonation by bomb squad experts in a pit dug outside the five-story apartment building because they were considered too dangerous to transport.In July, two attacks carried out by asylum seekers and claimed by the Islamic State group, in which multiple people were injured and the assailants were killed, put Germany on edge \u2014 along with two other attacks unrelated to Islamic extremism, including a deadly mall shooting in Munich.Authorities say Albakr came to Germany in the flood of 890,000 migrants who entered the country in 2015 and had been granted asylum.During the manhunt, federal police had increased security around the country, particularly around facilities such as train stations and airports.Breitbart London, Europe Migrant Crisis, Germany Migrants, migrant terror attacks, Syrian migrantsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But it raised fears among others that she had cornered herself into a total break with the bloc.The German chancellor, French president and heads of EU institutions in Brussels took a common line that May\u2019s demands to be free to bar EU immigrants and escape oversight by EU courts mean Britain cannot stay inside the EU single market.That, EU officials say, means a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, with London\u2019s best option perhaps a free trade deal, maybe a little better than a current EU offer to Canada.President Hollande endorsed the term \u201chard Brexit\u201d last week, making clear that if that is what Britons want, France will \u201cpush this wish through\u201d and ensure Britain ends up truly out.May hopes for \u201cpreparatory work\u201d with her EU counterparts to smooth the launch of formal talks. British officials want \u201cpre-negotiations\u201d before she writes to trigger the two-year exit process under Article 50 of the EU treaty.If her initial demands are rejected out of hand, she may have little domestic political room to water them down.\u201cPRE-PARATION\u201d?The EU mantra is \u201cno negotiation before notification\u201d. On Friday, Commission President Juncker said: \u201cWe won\u2019t negotiate before we\u2019ve had the British government\u2019s farewell letter.\u201d (The French term he used also means \u201csuicide note\u201d.)But May\u2019s pledge of a March deadline has eased concerns any talks would simply let the British keep talking without suffering the jeopardy inherent in Article 50\u2019s two-year time frame.One senior EU diplomat said setting a date for starting talks meant leaders would now be ready to \u201chelp\u201d May frame British demands before she writes her letter: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call that pre-negotiation but, perhaps, pre-paration,\u201d he said.A senior EU official said London may get \u201cpositive noises\u201d on what others can accept before the fateful letter: \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cIt will always be a leap into at least half darkness.\u201dBritish officials and politicians also talk of using economic muscle to secure concessions from other Europeans \u2014 whether poor eastern states which might put British offers of cash to help maintain EU subsidies before the migration rights of their citizens, or German carmakers keen to keep a market.That, argue EU diplomats and officials, may be to mistake the resolve of European leaders not just to defend their own economic interests but to prevent Britain securing a sweetheart deal that might encourage eurosceptic populism at home.\u201cMany Brexiters claim that the toughness of the 27 is merely an opening stance, and that, when talks commence, economic self-interest will push them to soften,\u201d wrote Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform. \u201cBut that may be wishful thinking.\u201dBRIDGES AND TRANSITIONSThe past week saw EU leaders line up to defend a hard line.\u201cIf we don\u2019t say full access to the internal market is linked to full freedom of movement, then a movement will spread in Europe where everyone just does whatever they want,\u201d Chancellor Merkel told German industrial leaders in Berlin, telling them she would not be pressured by sectional interests.Juncker was clearer still about a need to be \u201cintransigent\u201d to counter British lobbying: \u201cWe cannot have whole sections of European industry conducting secret talks in darkened rooms behind closed doors with envoys of the British government.\u201dMany British and some European officials say the freedom of movement of labour is not essential in economic terms to a common market in goods, services and capital. The EU messaging of the past week aims to show that it is essential politically.Even if governments might cut London slack on migration, the federalist European Parliament whose blessing any deal needs is unlikely to soften. A British push to evade EU courts but stay in the single market seems an even longer shot to EU officials.Juncker\u2019s Brexit negotiator, former French minister Michel Barnier, started work a week ago and will tour the 27 capitals to sound out the varying priorities of member states. Barnier\u2019s deputy Sabine Weyand, a German Commission staffer and expert on trade, is preparing for some of the toughest aspects of Brexit.Aides to EU summit chair Donald Tusk, led by Belgian diplomat Didier Seeuws, have already spent three months mapping out issues and procedures to run such complex, lengthy talks.Officials think they can wrap up the basics of divorce, such as dividing up shared assets and liabilities by 2019, but some kind of transition deal will also have to be struck as it will take years more to conclude a complete new trading relationship.They are working out how those two sets of talks can run in parallel: \u201cBridges and transitions will be pretty tricky,\u201d said one. \u201cIf you want to avoid disruption this will be the key.\u201dBreitbart London, Brexit, Brexit negotiationsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The report is said to note that since 2001 nearly all ter\u00adror plots in Britain have involved Islam\u00adists; the only hate mur\u00adders of Brit\u00adish Mus\u00adlims in the past three years were com\u00admitted by other Muslims such as the murder of moderate Ahmadi Muslim Asad Shah by a Sunni Muslim for \u201cdisrespecting Islam\u201d.Senior Home Office official Charlie Edwards has told a number of anti-extremism professionals in recent weeks that Ms. Casey\u2019s report will be \u201cdramatically\u201d rewritten and launched in a much \u201clower-key\u201d way than had been planned.Those who had spoken to Mr. Edwards, who is the advisor to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, told The Sunday Times that he wanted the report \u201cgutted\u201d and that the Home Office was trying to find a way to \u201cwater it down\u201d.Last year Ms. Casey, who is known to be outspoken on social issues, lambasted Rotherham council for its \u201cresolute denial\u201d and \u201cdeep-rooted\u201d culture of cover-ups in an official report on the grooming and sexual abuse of 1,400 children by\u00a0Muslim gangs.In July, the integration tsar said that\u00a0it was \u201cnot racist to say that the pace and rate of immigration\u00a0has\u00a0created a lot of change in Britain and for some people that feels too much\u201d, adding that that the government needs to be \u201cmuch bolder\u201d in celebrating British history, culture, and heritage.Ms. Casey was unavailable for comment, but she did tell one person: \u201cDon\u2019t ask an old big beast to write something if you don\u2019t want a big beast. Find yourself a puppet, find yourself a muppet if that\u2019s what you want.\u201dIn response, the Home Office refused to deny claims that the report was being censored, stating only that it would be published \u201cin due course\u201d.Breitbart London, Immigration, government censorship, home office, integration, Mass Migration, radical islamComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The company will redeploy some assets from its DHL Express operations to establish a parcels network in the two countries next year, she said.She said similar initiatives using existing assets would take precedence over big acquisitions.\u201cWe feel the house is the way we want it to be,\u201d she said, adding that further deals would add \u201ca nice piece of furniture\u201d.The growing popularity of internet shopping was driving demand for its parcels services, she said.In Germany, where it had 44 percent of the market in 2015, the group is expecting a record Christmas. \u201cWe have on average 4 million parcels a day (\u2026) we expect in the pre-Christmas peak to go up to 8 million parcels,\u201d she said.BREXIT OPPORTUNITYKreis said she was personally sad about Brexit, but the group had traded through many political and financial upheavals in the more than 220 countries where it operates and it would take Brexit in its stride.\u201cThe big noticeable thing at this point is the devaluation in the pound, but in terms of real underlying trading we don\u2019t see any deterioration in growth rates,\u201d she said.Brexit could be an opportunity, she said.\u201cWe are also very experienced in dealing with situations where there are trade regulations and complex customs regimes, that to a certain degree is something we sell to our customers,\u201d she said. \u201cComplex customs regulations are something where you as a logistics company can show your strength.\u201dIn terms of Deutsche Post\u2019s financial strategy, Kreis said the message was one of continuity.She wants to maintain the group\u2019s triple B plus credit rating, keep to its guidance of paying 40-60 percent of net profit as dividends, and redistribute excess liquidity to shareholders or use it to fund pensions.After a year beset by strikes, the company, which provides one in 200 German jobs, is rebuilding its profits. It has forecast operating profit this year of between 3.4 billion and 3.7 billion euros, up from 2.41 billion in 2015.(1 euro = 0.9008 pounds)Big Government, Breitbart London, National Security, Brexit, Deutsche Post DHL, European Union, Global tradeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

German news agency DPA, citing security sources, reported that Albakr had links to the Islamic State (IS) group.Police said \u201cseveral hundred grams\u201d of an \u201cexplosive substance even more dangerous than TNT\u201d were found in Albakr\u2019s apartment in the eastern city of Chemnitz, about 260 kilometres south of Berlin.\u201cEven a small quantity of this substance could have caused enormous damage,\u201d police said.Three people with links to Albakr, who arrived in Germany last year as a refugee, have been arrested in Chemnitz.Heavily-armed officers, some wearing balaclavas, carried out a vast operation in the neighbourhood where Albakr had been living.Around 100 local residents were evacuated from the area, and a loud explosion was heard in the leafy suburb as police forced their way into the apartment with an entry device.Germany has been on edge after suffering two attacks claimed by IS in July \u2014 an axe rampage on a train in Wuerzburg that injured five and a suicide bombing in Ansbach that left 15 wounded.Those two attacks rattled Germans\u2019 sense of security and fuelled concerns over the country\u2019s record influx of nearly 900,000 migrants and refugees last year.\u2013 Under surveillance \u2013In Chemnitz, part of the city\u2019s main station was sealed off by officers as a remote-controlled robot was deployed to inspect a suspect package on a platform which turned out to be harmless.Police destroyed the explosives found in the apartment in specially-dug holes on land nearby.Albakr had been under surveillance for some time, with the magazine Focus reporting that he was suspected of plotting to attack an airport.Two of his associates were arrested close to Chemnitz\u2019s railway station while a third was taken into custody in the city centre. A package belonging to one of those arrested was undergoing analysis, police added.\u201cThey were known to the suspect we are looking for and were arrested and detained,\u201d said Bernhardt, who added that the trio were being questioned.Albakr was living in a neighbourhood of Chemnitz whose communist-era housing estates are home to many recently arrived refugees.Police in the state of Saxony, where the city is located, issued a search warrant for Albakr after officers received information from domestic intelligence services, a police spokesman said, saying he was born in Syria in January 1994.They added that Albakr was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and was \u201csuspected of preparing a bomb attack\u201d, issuing an image of the man.\u201cAt present we do not know where (the suspect) is or what he is carrying,\u201d police said on Twitter, urging residents to be cautious.\u2013 Security threats \u2013German police said previously they had identified 523 people who posed a security threat to the country, around half of whom were known to be currently in Germany.On September 21 German officials said a 16-year-old Syrian refugee had been arrested on suspicion of planning a bomb attack in the name of IS.The youngster, thought to have been radicalised only recently, was detained in a special forces operation at a shelter for asylum seekers in the western city of Cologne, police and prosecutors said.Initial information gathered from the teenager\u2019s mobile phone showed that he had expressed an \u201cunmistakeable willingness\u201d to carry out an attack, Klaus-Stephan Becker of the Cologne police told reporters.A week earlier, German police detained three men with forged Syrian passports accused of being IS militants and labelled a possible \u201csleeper cell\u201d with links to the assailants behind the November attacks in Paris.More than 200 police took part in pre-dawn raids in northern Germany to detain the men, suspected of either plotting an attack or awaiting orders to commit one.German authorities have urged the public not to confuse migrants with \u201cterrorists\u201d, but have acknowledged that more jihadists may have entered the country among the nearly one million asylum seekers who arrived last year.Breitbart London, Europe Migrant Crisis, Germany Migrants, Islamic State in Europe, Jihad in Europe, Syrian migrantsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.\u201dSince HNA drew attention to the issue yesterday, Catholics and church figures have criticised the attitude of Sara Nussbaum House towards Christian festivals as part of a growing trend.Marita Gill, president of a Catholic nursery school, said that while 92 of the 98 children enrolled there have a migration background, they all enthusiastically celebrate Christmas. Ms. Gill said the children who attend St Boniface daycare centre, from 28 different nations, are \u201crarely so excited\u201d as when hearing Christmas stories during Advent.Ms. Gill said she often hears that Christian festivals now barely play a role at state daycare centres. She told HNA: \u201cThis is our culture, we must not lie [about it] or change it.\u201dPublic nurseries increasingly dropping Christian culture and festivals was reportedly much discussed at this week\u2019s Catholic City Conference.Conference chairman Marie Louise Labrie opined: \u201cKindergartens are places of integration. But there is clearly a confusion about what tolerance is.\u201d She said: \u201cOne must first recognise their own Christian culture and make sure they then can also appreciate other cultures.\u201dAsserting that Christmas is not only a cultural marker but also one of faith, Ms. Labrie added: \u201cWe should show the Muslim children what we find beautiful about Christmas. Conversely, they can show us in kindergarten what makes their religion special, like Ramadan for example.\u201dThe dean of the Catholic Church in Kassel, Harald Fischer, also contributed to the discussion on Christian values in daycare centres. He said: \u201cIntegration does not mean that we hide our Christian values behind alleged tolerance and multiculturalism.\u201dSaying he feared the topic could be \u201cexploited\u201d by right-wing parties, the dean added: \u201cMuslims are not the problem, but rather daycare centres who hide Christian traditions in anticipatory obedience.\u201dAnne Janz, the councillor responsible for youth affairs in Kassel, said parents should have taken their complaints directly to Sara Nussbaum House rather than contacting the press. Defending the practice of marginalising Christian festivals, the Green party politician insisted public nurseries make sure to \u201cconvey the core values of our Western Christian culture\u201d.Ms. Jantz said: \u201cWe do not conduct religious instruction, instead we have a\u00a0comfortable discussion of our values of solidarity, charity, sharing, and justice.

Medical staff were initially able to resuscitate the 15 year old, and took her to hospital, but she died yesterday of what toxicology reports indicate was a cocaine overdose.Shortly after the girl was discovered in Innsbruck, police brought a Syrian man in for questioning in relation to the case. The 22 year old told officials that he and a friend had watched through a window and seen two Moroccan men moving the girl to the stairwell.In subsequent interrogations, police found the Syrian\u2019s story to be full of contradictions and a second Syrian national was questioned. Eventually, they had to admit the girl had consumed drugs and alcohol in their apartment.The two men had moved the girl outside when she lost consciousness as they were afraid they would get in trouble with the police, the Tiroler Tageszeitung reported.The two men, both of whom have been granted asylum, are blaming one another for the girl\u2019s death. \u201cThey accuse each other. One Syrian says that the other gave the girl the cocaine and vice versa\u201d, an investigator working on the case told Kronen Zeitung.According to the spokesman for the Innsbruck prosecutor, Hansj\u00f6rg Mayr, the men are suspected of giving narcotic drugs to a minor and of failure to assist a wounded person.

They are just there for the pleasure of the man, and even more so if they are unbelievers.\u201dSpeaking about her years of aid work in Muslim countries, the sister recalled how she\u2019d listen as women cried about wounds to their breasts and genitals. \u201cAll atrocities committed in the name of Allah,\u201d Sister Hatune told the audience, adding: \u201cNot since yesterday but for centuries.\u201dAs the Order of Merit recipient recounted how people she helped in the Middle East told her that Islamic State terrorists would strike \u201cinfidel\u201d babies against a rock \u201cuntil there was no more head\u201d, an audience member cried out for Sister Hatune to stop.The woman told the nun the terrorists are \u201ca picture of Germany\u2019s own past\u201d and that Germans learned they must live with people of other religions, Baden Online reported.Sister Hatune warned the audience of false tolerance and cowardice, stating: \u201cThe door must remain open to genuine refugees, but not for those who want to revolutionise our society. If we remain silent, our entire future will be ruined.\u201dBorn in a small Christian village in Eastern Turkey, Sister Hatune fled to Germany with her parents and siblings at the age of 14 after Muslim neighbours threatened to kill her father for his religion.A few years later, after joining a Syrian-Orthodox monastery, and training in nursing and to be a school teacher, the Turkish nun began her 25 years of working to help the most persecuted and helpless people in Muslim countries.Dr Phyllis Chesler has written for Breitbart News about some of the work the sister and her charity, the Hatune Foundation, have done rescuing Christian and Yazidi girls from the clutches of Islamic State in Iraq.Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart London, Faith, Christians genocide, Christians in Middle East, ISIS, persecuted Christians, YazidiComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Police identified the assailant as a 39-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.A spokeswoman for the Israel Prisons Service said the attacker had been ordered by a court to start a four-month jail sentence next week after being convicted of assaulting a police officer.In the past year, Palestinians, many acting alone and often with rudimentary weapons, have killed at least 35 Israelis and two visiting Americans in attacks.During that period, at least 220 Palestinians have died in violent incidents in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

Zell maintains that among the reasons for his change of heart was witnessing Trump\u2019s staggering success in the primaries \u2013 winning 37 states to beat out 16 other candidates in the race.\u201cFirst and foremost, the people have spoken, and they have spoken in an unequivocal fashion,\u201d the Washington DC native told the\u00a0Times of Israel in August.Zell also praised the Republican platform for dropping the notion of the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d as an answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201cI\u2019m against unrealistic policies. I am against trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

Four civilians were killed by gunfire from an armored police vehicle in the town of Yuksekova near the Iranian border.On Thursday, a bomb attack near a police station in Istanbul wounded 10 people. The Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK), a PKK offshoot, claimed responsibility for that blast.The PKK, which launched a separatist insurgency in 1984, is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.A two-year ceasefire between the group and Turkish authorities collapsed in July last year and the violence subsequently rose to levels not seen since the height of the conflict in the 1990s.The surge in violence coincides with a Turkish military operation in northern Syria in support of rebels and designed to drive away from the border Islamic State militants and a Syrian Kurdish militia closely linked to the PKK.President Tayyip Erdogan chaired a security summit with the head of the armed forces and ministers in Istanbul on Saturday, but details of the meeting have not been disclosed.Breitbart Jerusalem, Middle East, National Security, Abdullah Ocalan, car bomb, Islamic State, Kurdistan Freedom Hawks, Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, President Tayyip Erdogan, Syrian Kurdish militia, Turkish militantsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Uncle Sam holds a basketball that doubles as a globe, and the soldier representing Israel is apparently directing him to slam-dunk the globe into a Star of David-shaped basket.The message is clear: America might\u00a0be seen as controlling the world but it\u2019s Israel that\u2019s calling the shots.The Palestinian Authority has in the past charged that Israel is directly responsible for civil wars around the world, as well the creation of the Islamic State terror group.Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019 Fatah published a cartoon (see right) blaming Israel for the terror attack in Paris that killed 130 people.More recently, Fatah\u2019s Information and Culture Commission published a cartoon showing Israel orchestrating Muslim infighting between Sunnis and Shiites in order to destroy both groups.On Saturday, Breitbart Jerusalem reported on another cartoon published by Fatah showing a yarmulke-wearing, hooked-nose Jew relaxing in an armchair etched with a Jewish Star of David while he uses a remote control to bomb buildings in Gaza.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, anti-Semitic cartoon, Cartoon, controlling world, Fatah, glorifying terror, Israel-Arab conflict, Jews, libel, Palestinian Authority, Palestinian Terrorism, President Mahmoud Abbas, Terrorists, Uncle SamComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The total number of olim for the entirety of 2015 was 7,835.JPPI mentioned several factors for the dramatic decline, among them the French authorities\u2019 commitment to battle anti-Semitism, the fact that most of the Zionist Jews in France have already made aliyah, and the rise of terrorist activity in Israel which has weakened its comparative appeal with French Jewry.Read more here.Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart London, National Security, aliyah, anti-semitism, French immigration, Israel security, Jewish Agency for Israel, Jewish Diaspora, Jewish faith, Judaism, olim, Zionist Jews in FranceComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He reportedly climbed to a second story window and broke in, according to a report by KXAN NBC in Austin. The incident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. on Sunday morning.After reportedly breaking the window to obtain entry to the capitol, Graeber intentionally damaged the portrait of former Texas Governor Fletcher Stockdale, DPS officials wrote in the arrest affidavit. He then tossed the portrait over the rotunda railing where it fell three stories to crash on the floor. The frame on the portrait was broken, officials stated.Fletcher Stockdale Portrait Courtesy Texas State Preservation Board.A trooper assigned to protect the capitol and a security officer later found the man inside the historic building and arrested him without incident.Graeber was charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief equal to or greater than $2,500 but less than $30,000. If convicted, he could spend up to two years in prison on each count.Fletcher Stockdale served briefly as governor of the Confederate State of Texas in the summer of 1865. He had been elected Lt. Governor in 1863 and succeeded Governor Pendleton Murrah as the state\u2019s chief executive when Murrah fled to Mexico at the end of the Civil War. Murrah, who was suffering tuberculosis at the time, fled to Monterry, Mexico, along with several other leaders of the Confederacy. He died from his illness a few months later, according to the Texas State Historical Association. Stockdale was one of the leaders of the secessionist movement in Texas and served on the committee on resolutions during secession meetings at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina. He served on the committee that drafted the ordinance of secession and was a signatory of the document. Stockdale was succeeded by Governor Andrew Jackson Hamilton, who was appointed as provisional governor by President Andrew Johnson after the surrender of the Confederate States of America to the Union.DPS officials have not stated whether the alleged actions by Graeber had anything specifically to do with Governor Stockdale or any kind of anti-Confederacy sentiment.A records check by Breitbart Texas of the Travis County jail revealed that Graeber is no longer in custody. It is not known if the Fort Worth resident has any prior criminal history.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Prosecutors presented their argument on the incident which purportedly happened on the previous Friday.The girl told police Appleby\u00a0instructed her to try on three choir robes inside the storage closet he converted into a dressing room. He told her she had to \u201ctake off her bra and panties to make sure it fit correctly,\u201d according to\u00a0KTRK.Prosecutors asserted Appleby secretly filmed the teenager\u00a0after telling her to strip naked\u00a0to try on the robes, KHOU\u00a0reported. The teen apparently requested to change in a\u00a0bathroom but Appleby told her to\u00a0use the\u00a0closet. Prosecutor Angela Weltin later told reporters that Appleby \u201cinstructed her that there were several sizes, to make sure she tried them all on\u201d and to take off all her undergarments \u201cto show no lines in the gown.\u201d \u00a0Weltin said the girl was in the process of changing into her third gown when she noticed a box, inside of which was a video recorder.In the courtroom, prosecutors said the teen\u00a0called her mother on her cell phone to ask for her advice on what to do. Allegedly, the girl\u2019s mother told her to take the camera with her. Appleby noticed the camera and box were missing. According to prosecutors, he confronted her. She turned over the camera to him. Then, the teacher\u00a0and the teen put the memory card in a school computer where the girl claimed she saw herself naked on video, also according to KHOU.\u00a0The prosecution stated Appleby instructed her to delete the video, which she did.Appleby was in his \u201cfifth year of teaching vocal music to young adults\u201d and his \u201cthird year as the Associate Choir Director\u201d at Mayde High School, according to the school\u2019s website, which since removed the\u00a0now former choir teacher\u2019s bio. Appleby previously taught choir in Oklahoma City at Hefner Middle School from 2012-13.\u00a0Under his direction, four choirs received sweepstakes for two consecutive years. He\u00a0was also a finalist for Teacher of the Year in 2013 while working at the Oklahoma middle school, according to the Katy ISD website.Katy ISD\u00a0campus police arrested Appleby, Friday, on the\u00a0charge of felony improper photography.\u00a0He bonded out of jail on $30,000 bail, and the school district fired him. On\u00a0Saturday night, October 8, Katy school district\u00a0officials issued a statement to Mayde High School parents:Dear Mayde Creek High School Parents and Guardians,Yesterday evening the Assistant Choir Director, Clarence Appleby, was arrested by the Katy ISD Police Department for alleged inappropriate use of a visual recording device on campus.Appleby faces a state felony charge for invasive visual recording and was terminated immediately.Thanks to the quick thinking of a student and a parent who informed the school, campus administration was able to work with the Katy ISD Police Department to arrest and charge Appleby.Due to the nature of the incident, not much information can be disclosed at this time, as this continues to be an ongoing investigation, but please rest assured that the safety of all students is our top priority and such allegations are taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly.Parents were shocked by the allegations against Appleby. One mother, Anessa Hall Joseph, told KTRK she hoped this was not true and that something positive would come from this situation.When he first appeared in court on October 7, Appleby did so\u00a0without an attorney, noted\u00a0KHOU. His wife, also a choir teacher at a different school, accompanied him.\u00a0His\u00a0next court date is November 8. If convicted, he\u00a0may face anywhere from six months up to two years in prison, said prosecutors.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Clarence Appleby III, Inappropriate Educator Relationships, Katy ISD, Mayde High School, Teacher-Student Sexual Misconduct, Texas EducationComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The investigation provides harsh criticism of Mexico\u2019s government for being complicit in the cover-up of the crimes. Earlier this year, Breitbart Texas revealed the results of a three month investigation into the Massacre of Allende, where gunmen with the Los Zetas cartel kidnapped, tortured and used ovens, or 55-gallon drums to incinerate their victims. Mainstream media in the U.S. has ignored the Massacre of Allende.The investigation by Breitbart Texas was based on personal interviews as well as U.S. and Mexican court documents that revealed that the leadership of Los Zetas sought to enact revenge on two high ranking associates who had turned themselves over to U.S. authorities in exchange for protection to become informants. The perceived betrayal of the two associates was met with a swift response by the former leader of Los Zetas Miguel Angel \u201cEl 40\u201d Trevino Morales and his brother Omar \u201cEl 42\u201d Trevi\u00f1o Morales. The two men ordered the kidnapping murder of every person who was related to, knew or may have been an acquaintance of the turncoats.  After Breitbart Texas\u2019 report, the Coahuila government was shamed into admitting publicly that between 100 and 150 of the murder victims had been incinerated inside the Piedras Negras prison in 55-gallon drums.In his new report, Mexican activist Sergio Aguayo criticizes the apparent cover-up of the massacre by the Coahuila Government, since the case was largely ignored for more than three years. In contrast, Aguayo presents the swift response of the Mexican government of the Los Zetas execution of 72 illegal immigrants in San Fernando, Tamaulipas in 2010. In that case, in a matter of weeks, the Mexican military managed to arrest dozens of Zetas and corrupt cops tied to the case. Due to his ongoing work in uncovering corruption, Aguayo has been sued by Coahuila\u2019s former governor Humberto Moreira who claims that the activist has slandered him.Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Eduardo Luna has previously been identified as \u201cComandante Pajarito\u201d or Commander Birdie, a lieutenant with Mexico\u2019s Gulf Cartel. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, in March 2015, tourists fishing during spring break at the beach resort city of South Padre Island discovered the body of Juan Francisco \u201cFranklin\u201d Palacios Paz. The victim, who had been previously deported, was tortured and beheaded before being dumped in the water. By November 2015, authorities had arrested Joel Luna\u2013making public the apparent link between a Mexican drug cartel distribution network and the beheading of Palacios. The murder appears to have been linked to a tire shop in the Texas border city of Edinburg that was owned by one of the Luna brothers and may have been used as part of a marijuana smuggling operation.\u00a0During a raid at one of the homes tied to the Luna family, authorities found drugs, cash, a border patrol rifle, badge, and a jeweled handgun. As the trial drew near, some of the defendants, including another of the Luna brothers named Fernando, have agreed to plea guilty to lesser charges. In exchange for Fernando Luna\u2019s guilty plea, he managed to avoid being convicted in connection with the beheading. It appears that once the trial starts, Fernando Luna may be testifying against his two brothers.Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

More than\u00a068,000 fraud complaints have been filed in the region in the region from at least 40 disasters since 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina.Green said that over 50,000 of those complaints have been referred to local authorities and law enforcement agencies.Scammers following disasters usually come in the form of federal emergency aid and phony contractors who are looking to scam homeowners.Green told the media that fraudsters are already defrauding residents who have seen disaster during Hurricane Matthew. He said they have already received one call coming in about a scam.This is not the first case where Louisiana flood victims have seen more than just flood disaster, but also a blackout of media coverage, obliviousness from politicians and a lack of monetary help from donors.As Breitbart Texas reported, donations for Louisiana\u2019s 2016 flood victims have been far less compared to the donations that came in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy.Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been largely criticized for their slow response and lack of help to Louisiana flood victims, as Breitbart Texas reported.Almost a month after the storm touched down in the region, FEMA had only set up one \u201cmanufactured housing unit\u201d in the area, despite more than 100,000 damaged homes and 60,000 homes fully destroyed.Two weeks after the storm, more than 1,400 residents remained in shelters, as a large number of homeowners did not carry flood insurance because the region had never flooded in the past.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Municipal police officers Jose Luis Martinez Canela and Enrique Fabela Guerrero began a\u00a0pursuit of the fleeing SUV. In an attempt to stop the vehicle, 28-year-old Martinez Canela fired 10 shots. As a result of the shooting, the underage males and one man who had been riding in the vehicle were inured. One of the boys was identified as 9-year-old Omar David Velazquez Aguilar from Honduras. The boy was airlifted to a hospital in Monterrey for a gunshot wound to the chest. Carlos Miguel Velazquez Aguilar, 6, received some superficial injuries to his head and remains at a local hospital with his aunt Duna Maria Aguilar Agueta. The woman said that she and her two nephews had travelled from Honduras in an effort to get to the border in an effort to cross illegally into McAllen, Texas. Emergency medical personnel also treated 14-year-old Andy William Tovara Bautista and German Tovara Pacheco who had also been injured. Law enforcement sources consulted by Breitbart Texas revealed that just minutes before the fatal chase, there had been a gun battle in the city of Linares, just 15 miles away. Preliminary information points to the officers having been warned about the possible presence of fleeing gunmen. In the aftermath of the shooting, Martinez has been arrested and charged with\u00a0of abuse of authority and injury to a child. The Public Safety Director from the city of General Teran, Enrique Sanmiguel resigned from his post immediately after the shooting.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

Federal authorities filed the action just one week to the day before the Texas AG was to represent the Lone Star State and half the states in their fight at the U.S. Supreme Court against President Obama\u2019s Administration\u2019s executive\u00a0amnesty order.As reported by Breitbart News, the executive amnesty case was historic because this was only the second time in U.S. history where America\u2019s highest court was to decide a challenge brought by a majority of states against the federal government. It was also historic in that it involved the scope of presidential power under the U.S. Constitution.The motion to dismiss filed by lead counsel Matthew T. Martens\u00a0(Washington, D.C.), Dallas lawyer William B. Mateja, and Frisco lawyer J. Mitchell Little, urged that the federal complaint for securities fraud \u201cdoes not allege that [Paxton] made a single false or misleading statement.\u201d The complaint did however, accuse Servergy\u2019s co-founder and then-CEO and Chairman William E. Mapp, III, of leading investors to believe that a \u201crevolutionary new server\u201d \u201cwas in high demand.\u201d It stated that Mapp falsely claimed that notable companies like Amazon.com and Freescale Semiconductors had pre-ordered the product. This was just one of the misrepresentations alleged by the SEC against Mapp in the complaint.In June Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported, that Paxton\u2019s lawyers, including Martens who had\u00a0previously served as the chief litigation counsel in the enforcement division at the SEC, filed a motion to dismiss the SEC civil lawsuit (with prejudice). He wrote, \u201cIn short, the SEC\u2019s claims against Mr. Paxton are a dramatic overreach and lack any basis in law.\u201dPaxton\u2019s lawyers filed the\u00a029-page pleading and urged that the SEC had not claimed that Paxton ever lied or made a misrepresentation, and no one had alleged that they lost money in any of the transactions involving Paxton. The motion also stated that the SEC\u2019s argument that Paxton failed to disclose that he could receive a commission for touting securities, and that he had not investigated the company, ran counter to decades of case law precedent that has never required such discussions or actions.Federal regulators say Paxton raised $840,000 for Servergy, a high-tech startup, without telling investors that he was being paid. They alleged Paxton was paid\u00a0100,000 shares for bringing on investors in 2011.In the Court\u2019s order, the Judge Amos L. Mazzant, III (an Obama appointee) wrote, \u201cThis case is not about whether Paxton had a moral obligation to disclose his financial\u00a0arrangement with Servergy to potential investors. This case is also not about whether Paxton had\u00a0some general obligation to disclose his financial arrangement to his investor group. The only\u00a0issue before the Court is to determine whether the facts as pleaded give rise to a plausible claim\u00a0under federal securities laws. With that limitation in mind, the Court has determined that under\u00a0the facts pleaded by the Commission, Paxton did not have a legal obligation to disclose his\u00a0financial arrangement.\u201dThe Court concluded \u201cthat the Complaint has not alleged facts sufficient to support a plausible\u00a0claim under Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act or Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the\u00a0Exchange Act.\u201dThe SEC asked the Court to give it an opportunity to amend its Complaint and the federal judge responded saying that \u201cWhile this request does not satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of\u00a0Civil Procedure 15, the Court is inclined to allow the Commission to plead additional facts, if\u00a0any, before it grants the motion and dismisses the Commission\u2019s claims against Paxton.\u201dThe Court ordered that Paxton\u2019s Motion to Dismiss was conditionally granted \u201cpending the Court\u2019s review of the\u00a0Commission\u2019s submission of additional facts.\u201d He granted the Commission \u201cleave to\u00a0amend its allegations against Paxton to the extent that it has additional facts that might support a\u00a0claim under the statutes alleged in the Complaint.\u201d\u201cThis is a victory for Ken Paxton. Obviously, we are pleased with the Court\u2019s ruling today,\u201d said Matthew Martens.\u00a0Bill Mateja, a lawyer on both Paxton\u2019s SEC and criminal defense teams added \u201cnow we turn our attention to Ken\u2019s exoneration in the state matter where the prosecutor\u2019s burden is even higher. The fraud allegations in the SEC case mirror those in the state case.\u201dAny amendment to the Complaint by the Commission was ordered to be filed within 14 days of the October 7th order.The Judge also ordered that \u201cthe Commission must place any new facts not\u00a0previously alleged in the original Complaint in bold typeface.\u201dLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

The agency had previously claimed an 81 percent success rate, the AP reported.Members of Congress had demanded the 98-page report be released after it was completed nearly five months ago.\u201cDHS does not believe it is in the public interest to release, and it would be irresponsible to make policy or other judgments on the basis of analysis that is incomplete and remains a work in progress,\u201d DHS Spokesman Marsha Catron told the AP on Thursday.The report appears to confirm the popular sentiment that borders are not secure. During FY 2017, 170,000 illegal aliens eluded DHS law enforcement agencies by crossing the border without detection or capture. Another 30,000 entered without being captured at ports of entry or via sea crossings, the report states.The report does show a decline in the numbers of uncaptured illegal aliens. The FY 2015 numbers were down from the previous year\u2019s number of 260,000. They were significantly down from FY 2005 when 1.9 million entered without being captured.Some of those decreases can be credited to increased law enforcement along the border, but much of it is also a reflection of the weakened American economy wrought by the Great Recession.The AP\u2019s analysis of the report states, \u201cThe Border Patrol achieved an 11-point improvement in 2014 after years of slow but steady gains. The report does not offer an explanation for the sudden improvement.\u201dWhat that analysis ignores is the phenomena that began in 2014 when huge numbers of unaccompanied minors and incomplete family units flooded across the border to literally turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents at the border. These numbers alone could have a significant impact on the percentage of those captured versus those who were allowed to escape into the country undetected.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The Los Zeta gunmen began shooting at the troops in an effort to elude capture, setting off a fierce firefight. The exchange of bullets damaged various houses and cars in the neighborhood yet no civilians were injured. At the end of the skirmish, two of the Los Zetas gunmen had been killed. Emergency personnel rushed Communications Specialist Yovani Calderon, a Mexican soldier, to a local hospital. The soldier received a a gunshot wound that proved to be fatal. Mexican authorities continued to search for the Los Zetas shooters through the night.Communications Specialist Yovani CalderonCalderon\u2019s murder comes just days after the Mexican Military released new statistics that place the border state of Tamaulipas as the entity with the most soldiers killed. Since 2012, Tamaulipas has seen 24 soldiers killed; Jalisco is the second state with the most casualties at 17 soldiers killed in the line of duty. Breitbart Texas recently reported on a cartel ambush in Culiacan, Sinaloa. In that attack, at least 60 gunmen with the Sinaloa Cartel ambushed a convoy of 17 Mexican soldiers who were escorting an ambulance that had been transporting an injured cartel lieutenant. The gunmen killed five soldiers and injured 10 others. Last month, Breitbart Texas reported on another cartel gun battle in the border city of Reynosa where another Mexican soldier was killed. The results of a forensic investigation that Breitbart Texas had access to revealed that the soldier was killed by friendly fire.

Preliminary information points to the teen running away with Guerra, however due to her age, the case became criminal in nature. Guerra has since been charged with one count of aggravated kidnapping, her bond was set at $200,000.In response to the kidnapping, Texas cops reached out to their counterparts in Mexico. Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office (PGR) issued an Amber alert in an effort to locate the missing teen.According to information released by the Tamaulipas government, members of the state police unit located the teen at a a local business that belonged to a relative of Guerra. The relative told authorities that Guerra had convinced the teen to return to Texas to avoid getting in trouble with authorities. Mexican authorities claim they took Guerra to one of the local bridges for her arrest by Texas authorities.

The Texas and California attorneys general worked together on a lengthy investigation and found evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution. Backpage.com allegedly did so thorough escort ads on its website.\u201cMaking money off the backs of innocent human beings by allowing them to be exploited for modern-day slavery is not acceptable in Texas,\u201d Attorney General Paxton said. \u201cI intend to use every resource my office has to make sure those who profit from the exploitation and trafficking of persons are held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\u201dAlmost 35 members of the Texas AG\u2019s Law Enforcement Unit participated in the arrest of Backpage\u2019s CEO. They also executed a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of the business at 2501 Oak Lawn Avenue, Dallas, Texas.Backpage is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in North America.\u00a0Backpage.com is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation (LLC), incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Dallas. It operates a worldwide online classified ad site on which people can post or locate an adult escort advertisement, among other things. An affidavit for a search warrant stated, \u201cIt is currently the single largest purveyor of Internet sex ads in the United States, and Backpage.com\u2019s profits from this line of business register in the millions yearly.\u201dAn affidavit for a search warrant obtained by Breitbart Texas asked for items that were believed to be implements or instruments used in the commission of a crime, namely money laundering and prostitution or pimping. All business and financial records pertaining to Backpage.com, its parent companies or companies that have an invested interest in\u00a0Backpage.com were targeted, as well as all business and financial documents pertaining or related to\u00a0Backpage.com shareholders, namely Carl Ferrer, Jim Larkin, and Michael Lacey.The affidavit completed by a peace officer also asked for all identifying documents and images that related to Backpage or its parent companies. Cell phones, SIM cards and other memory cards or equipment related to cell phones in the care, custody, or control of Ferrer were also sought.Any documents showing what person or persons exercise control over the business, and all computer hardware, and all digital storage device passwords and other data security devices designed to restrict access to or hide computer, were also laid out in the affidavit.The affidavit included a request that \u201cmembers of the California Department of Justice and California Attorney General\u2019s Office be permitted to accompany Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office agents in the execution of this search warrant and that any evidence seized, be shared with California Attorney General\u2019s Office and any law enforcement personnel working at their direction.\u201dSergeant Cora Gray, the affiant, is assigned to the Human Trafficking and Transnational/Organized Crime Section, Criminal Investigations Division at the Office of the Attorney General of Texas.The Sergeant is specially-trained in the area of trafficking and has, over the last four years, conducted hundreds of searches on Backpage.com and followed tips to search for missing and exploited children.The probable cause stated within the affidavit for a search warrant includes (among other things):The adult escort ads posted on Backpage.com are advertisements for prostitution, the exchange of sexual acts for a fee. People engaged in prostitution pay Backpage.com to post advertisements soliciting potential buyers for their sexual services.Backpage receives more than 90% of their revenues from the adult escort ad portion of their classified advertising. In California, that amounts to approximately $50 million in revenues for the period between January 2013 to May 31, 2015, or between $1.5 to $2.5 million per month.CARL FERRER has been the CEO of Backpage.com since 2012, but has handled the day-to-day operations for the company for much longer. Carl Ferrer has been told directly by law enforcement about prostitution on Backpage.com, and is regularly copied on the hundreds of law enforcement subpoenas and requests that Backpage.com receives each year related to prostitution and sex trafficking of both adults and minors on the website. Ferrer\u2019s communications and emails obtained by search warrant, his interactions with law enforcement, and even the public statements of his high level executives, such as his General Counsel, reflect personal knowledge that Backpage.com derives support or maintenance from the earnings of people engaged in prostitution.California\u2019s Pimping statute provides that it is a criminal offense \u201cknowing another person is a prostitute,\u201d to \u201clive, derive support or maintenance from the earnings or proceeds of a person\u2019s prostitution,\u201d or to \u201csolicit or receive compensation for soliciting for the person.\u201d California\u2019s crime of pimping is a felony punishable between three to eight years of imprisonment.Pimping qualifies as a \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under the Texas Penal Code section for Money Laundering because it is an offense \u201cpunishable by confinement for more than one year under the laws of another state.\u201d The credit cards, gift cards, debit cards, Bitcoin, and cash used to purchase ads for prostitution on Backpage.com all qualify as \u201cfunds\u201d under the Texas Penal Code.Under the Texas Money Laundering statute, the court can consider all $50 million generated by Backpage.com\u2019s adult escort section in the state of California when classifying this offense because it constitutes an ongoing business model and a continuing course of conduct, says the affidavit. \u201cIf proceeds of criminal activity are related to one scheme or continuing course of conduct, whether from the same or several sources, the conduct may be considered as one offense and the value of the proceeds aggregated in determining the classification of the offense.\u201dUnder the Texas Money Laundering statute, an offense under this section is:1. a state jail felony if the value of the funds is $2,500 or more but less than $30,000;2. a felony of the third degree if the value of the funds is $30,000 or more but less than $150,000;3. a felony of the second degree if the value of the funds is $150,000 or more but less than $300,000; or4. a felony of the first degree if the value of the funds is $300,000 or more.The investigation began after there were reports from law enforcement agencies, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and news stories about children who were repeatedly exploited for commercial sex on Backpage.com.The affidavit also says that \u201cSince 2012, NCMEC has worked on more than 400 cases involving children sold for commercial sex on Backpage.com. During this same time period, NCMEC has reported 2,900 instances to California law enforcement where suspected child sex trafficking occurred via Backpage.com.Law enforcement officials state that Backpage.com describes itself in public presentations and internal documents as the second largest online classified advertising service in the country.Last January, Attorney General Paxton launched a Human Trafficking and Transnational/Organized Crime (HTTOC) unit. The division works closely with prosecutors around the state to bring human traffickers to arrest and trial.Most recently, HTTOC worked with the Nueces County District Attorney\u2019s Office to secure a 40-year sentence for the trafficker of a 15-year-old victim.In July 2015, Breitbart Texas reported that a\u00a0former Galveston County judge had been charged with posting online ads indicating an ex-girlfriend, and a woman who had spurned his advances, were available for sexual services for pay.\u00a0The controversial ex-judge was arrested on two counts of felony online impersonation.In early September, Attorney General Paxton met with a group of truckers who are committed to help spot and report human trafficking on the highways, reported Breitbart Texas. Law enforcement professionals and truck drivers working together has proven to be an effective tool to stop the trafficking and abuse of many young girls in this country.\u00a0Paxton\u2019s office has conducted more than 50 training sessions statewide since the beginning of 2016.

Through investigation, officers learned both teens had each worn the mask at one point.They also found Defelice had posted a photo on Snapchat Tuesday morning of one of the two wearing the mask while riding in Defelice\u2019s truck.The two teenagers are now facing a sentence of no less than six months in prison with a maximum of three years, Sheriff Craig Webre said in a news release.\u201cLast week we issued a stern warning that this \u2018creepy clown\u2019 activity would not be tolerated and violators would be charged,\u201d Webre said in a statement. \u201cWith rumors running rampant throughout the country, these individuals are deciding to exploit public fears for some sort of personal enjoyment, and that is simply despicable. We hope these two students serve as a lesson to others that this type of behavior will result in criminal charges.\u201dLafourche Parish School District Superintendent Jo Ann Matthews said \u201cOur school administrators will not tolerate any student causing a significant disturbance on our school campus.\u201dLocal investigators said they were aware of several social media accounts purportedly opened by individuals posing as clowns with masks that appear sinister or menacing in nature.\u201cClown or not, anyone making threats of violence to others in any form, including social media, will be investigated,\u201d Webre said. \u201cWe have a great track record of working with social media outlets to identify perpetrators, even when they open an account under anonymity. The bottom line is, we will find you, and you will be charged. We will not tolerate anyone terrorizing our community and especially our schools.\u201dLikewise, in St. James Parish, authorities began searching for two individuals who walked into a local grocery story wearing clown masks, but did not \u201cact aggressively,\u201d according to the local sheriff\u2019s office.The sheriff\u2019s office announced days ago that one of the individuals involved in the clown operation had been identified, but that since he was cooperating with authorities, his name would not be released.\u201cThe individual stated that it was just an attempt at a practical joke,\u201d the St. James Sheriff\u2019s Office wrote on their Facebook page. \u201cHowever, charges may be forthcoming. We would like to assure the public that there is no threat to public safety regarding this incident.\u201dLast week, Breitbart Texas reported how another Louisiana law enforcement agency made a stern warning to pranksters, saying that clown sightings in public would not be tolerated and perpetrators would be charged with \u201cterrorizing\u201d the community.\u201cIf there is someone out there that thinks this is some type of fun prank that gives you attention you so strive, let me warn you now, that if you do ANYTHING that disrupts the safe learning environment for our kids, we will find you and charge you criminally with all of the laws at our disposal up to and including terrorizing,\u201d Covington Police Chief Tim Lentz wrote in his public message on\u00a0Facebook.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

And I am going to make that case every chance I get.\u201dAlthough the audio recording offers no clarity as to where exactly Clinton believes SCOTUS got it \u201cwrong\u201d on the Second Amendment, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin has since made it abundantly clear that Hillary\u2019s\u00a0disagreement is with the District of Columbia v Heller\u00a0(2008) decision. Heller was a reaffirmation that the Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment to protect a fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.Clinton\u2019s disagreement with the Heller decision runs so deep that she twice refused to admit the right to bear arms is constitutional during the June 5 airing of This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u00a0When Stephanopoulos first asked her if the right to bear arms is constitutional, she would only obfuscate, saying:I think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment, until the decision by the late Justice [Antonin] Scalia. And there was no argument until then that localities, and states, and the federal government had a right\u2013as we do with every amendment\u2013to impose reasonable regulations.Stephanopoulos followed up, pressing her to give a direct answer as to whether the right to bear arms is constitutional. Clinton said, \u201cIf it is a constitutional right, then it\u2013like every constitutional right\u2013is subject to reasonable regulation.\u201dAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

But it also showed that Trump exceeded expectations, which impressed undecided voters.Frank Luntz\u2019s focus group of undecided voters on Fox News saw a massive shift away from Clinton and towards Trump, prompting him to declare: \u201cTonight was so significant that Trump is back in this race.\u201dPollsters and pundits debate whether presidential debates actually affect the outcome of elections. Republicans took heart in 2012 when challenger Mitt Romney handily defeated President Barack Obama in their first debate. But the Obama campaign\u2019s data mining team claimed to have the election in the bag already, and Romney\u2019s poor performance in the remaining debates may simply have sealed his defeat.Still, Trump\u2019s strong showing on Sunday left a far different impression than Romney\u2019s performance in the second debate in 2012, when he yielded to Obama and moderator Candy Crowley on the Benghazi issue.The Las Vegas debate will be the candidates\u2019 last chance to make a strong impression on voters on a national stage. Once again, Trump will likely enjoy the benefit of low expectations, since the media are determined to deny him an outright victory in the second contest.But Las Vegas is home turf for Trump, and a gambling city loves the underdog.

Felix was charged with attempted murder, discharging a firearm causing great bodily injury and association with a criminal street gang.After Felix was released from on those charges, a detective went to his father\u2019s house looking for his brother three years ago and recognized Felix, who was on parole at the time.In a police report about the event three years ago, the detective said: \u201cI know that John is a member of a criminal street gang and has been involved in multiple shootings. Due to John\u2019s angry and agitated state, and history of violence, I requested dispatch to have an additional unit respond.\u201dAfter allegedly scuffling with the detective, Felix was charged with resisting arrested, but the charge was dropped.That incident, three years ago, happened at the same address where police say John Hernandez Felix lured police on Saturday with a call about a domestic disturbance before gunning down two police officers. One of the officers, Jose Gilbert \u201cGil\u201d Vega, was a 35-year veteran of the Palm Springs Police Department. The other, Lesley\u00a0Zerebny, was a rookie and new mother.

They also executed a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of the business at 2501 Oak Lawn Avenue. A search reveals that Ferrer is no longer in the Harris County, Texas jail. The Sacramento Bee reports that he is in a Sacramento jail and is being held without bail.Backpage is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in the United States.\u00a0Backpage.com\u00a0has its principal place of business in Dallas but it is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation (LLC).The website operates a worldwide online classified advertising site. Among other ads, people can post or locate adult escort advertisement services.\u00a0An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by Breitbart Texas stated, \u201cIt is currently the single largest purveyor of Internet sex ads in the United States, and\u00a0Backpage.com\u2019s profits from this line of business register in the millions yearly.\u201dThe Texas and California attorneys general worked together on a lengthy investigation and found evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the website a \u201cdeep-seated evil\u201d and \u201cmodern-day slavery.\u201d He explained that the victims that are sex trafficked include both voluntary and involuntary participants and minors.The probable cause stated within the affidavit for a search warrant stated included that Backpage.com\u00a0receives more than 90% of their revenues from adult escort ads. Just in California, those revenues for January 2013 to May 31, 2015 was $50 million, or between $1.5 to $2.5 million per month. It stated that Ferrer has been the CEO of the website since 2012 but has handled the day-to-day operations for the company for a much longer period. All business and financial records of shareholders Ferrer, Jim Larkin and Michael Lacey were targeted in the affidavit for search warrant.It also said that \u201cFerrer\u2019s communications and emails obtained by search warrant, his interactions with law enforcement, and even the public statements of his high level executives, such as his General Counsel, reflect personal knowledge that\u00a0Backpage.com derives support or maintenance from the earnings of people engaged in prostitution.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s Pimping statute provides that it is a criminal offense \u201cknowing another person is a prostitute,\u201d to \u201clive, derive support or maintenance from the earnings or proceeds of a person\u2019s prostitution,\u201d or to \u201csolicit or receive compensation for soliciting for the person.\u201d Ferrer faces a sentence from between three to eight years of imprisonment under the California felony pimping statute.In Texas, Ferrer also faces money laundering charges. Pimping qualifies as a \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under the Texas Penal Code section for money laundering because it is an offense \u201cpunishable by confinement for more than one year under the laws of another state.\u201d The credit cards, gift cards, debit cards, Bitcoin, and cash used to purchase ads for prostitution on Backpage.com all qualify as \u201cfunds\u201d under the Texas Penal Code.\u00a0Under the Texas Money Laundering statute, the court can consider all $50 million generated by the websites\u2019s adult escort section in California when classifying this offense because it constitutes an ongoing business model and a continuing course of conduct, says the affidavit. \u201cIf proceeds of criminal activity are related to one scheme or continuing course of conduct, whether from the same or several sources, the conduct may be considered as one offense and the value of the proceeds aggregated in determining the classification of the offense.\u201dAn offense in Texas for money laundering is a felony of the first degree if the value of the funds is $300,000 or more. Conviction would be punishable in prison time from five to 99 years up to life, and a fine of up to $10,000.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Pollak8 Oct 20160Inside, there was excited talk about the new Tea Party class, about fixing Washington, about finding places to live in high-rent D.C. And there was also talk about women \u2014 that kind of talk.Some of the new members, many of whom had spent the day surrounded by young, attractive, ingratiating, dressed-to-the-nines female would-be staffers, wondered aloud how they were going to avoid the temptations of being surrounded every day by such creatures.The details do not matter: suffice it to say the language used was not that much better than\u00a0the newly-surfaced lewd chat that\u00a0Donald Trump had with Billy Bush on a live mic, eleven long years ago.Not every man talks that way about women. But plenty do \u2014 in the locker room, on the golf course, and on Capitol Hill. I was once taken aback when one\u00a0congressman praised\u00a0my wife\u2019s looks, in rather lurid terms.Some of the same\u00a0Republicans are beating\u00a0a disgraceful retreat from Trump, acting as if they have never heard such language before.Lewd talk is bipartisan. Elections are about choices, and the choice on the Democratic side is not Pope Francis, but the Clintons. Bill not only had oral sex with an intern in the Oval Office, and lied about it, but has faced repeated\u00a0accusations\u00a0of sexual assault. Hillary has done her part by attacking Bill\u2019s accusers, calling them\u00a0\u201cbimbo eruptions.\u201dPerhaps the most glaring case of hypocrisy is that of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\u00a0In his bodybuilding days, Schwarzenegger was notorious for \u2014 and proud of \u2014 his many exploits with women. In his 1977 autobiography, Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder, Schwarzenegger recalled how he had once treated women as \u201csex objects.\u201d (He said his views had changed.) When he ran for governor, he faced questions about a 1977 interview in which he recalled rough sex with a woman at a California gym: \u201cEverybody jumped on her and took her upstairs where we all got together,\u201d he had said.As governor, Schwarzenegger not only cheated on his wife, Kennedy scion Maria Shriver, but impregnated the housekeeper.Yet on Saturday, The Terminator joined the chorus of critics bashing Trump, telling fellow Republicans that it was their \u201cduty\u201d to \u201cchoose your country over your party\u201d when they voted.Sen. John McCain, whose own treatment of women was a topic of concern in the 2008 election \u2014 dating strippers, alleged affairs, rumors that he used the \u201cc-word\u201d towards his wife \u2014 withdrew\u00a0his support for Trump on Saturday. And 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who was accused of leading a \u201cwar on women\u201d and ridiculed for his\u00a0statement about \u201cbinders full of women,\u201d slammed\u00a0the Republican nominee (again) for a statement made long before Romney eagerly sought his endorsement in 2012.Other Republican leaders are demanding\u00a0Trump drop out of the race. The Republican National Committee has\u00a0withdrawn its mailings for Trump. Chuck Todd of NBC News\u00a0reported Saturday that right now,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s every Republican for themselves.\u201dThey are worried that Trump\u2019s 2005 comments \u2014 made when he was a businessman, TV star, and private citizen \u2014 will be the next Todd Akin moment, when Republicans let Democrats saddle them with one odd\u00a0comment about abortion in 2012.\u00a0Then as now, Republicans compounded the damage by treating a media\u00a0controversy as a \u201ccrisis.\u201dIt is worth asking whether this panicked\u00a0mob has the rudimentary\u00a0courage required to stand up to the Islamic State, or Vladimir Putin, if they cannot bear the pressure of a manufactured \u201cOctober surprise.\u201dIf they are willing to lose the country \u2014 for that is what may\u00a0be at stake \u2014 over a decade-old joke, they might deserve to lose.And if Trump wins regardless, look out: he will have done it on his own.Joel B.

The fingerprint reader\u00a0is akin to those found on iphones\u2013which also won\u2019t unlock the phone if the user\u2019s finger is wet.According to The Wall Street Journal, Kloepfer was first motivated to design the smart gun after seeing news of James Holmes\u2019 July 2012 attack on the Aurora movie theater. But Kloepfer admits his smart gun would not have prevented that attack, as Holmes purchased all his guns legally\u2013via background checks\u2013and would, therefore, be the authorized user of a Glock 22 with a fingerprint reader.Kloepfer\u2019s smart gun is called \u201cBiofire\u201d and he expects to have \u201ca live-firing prototype\u201d in a few months. He has already won a grant from the\u00a0Smart Tech Challenges Foundation and the support of Ron Conway, an investor \u201cknown for his early-stage backing of Google, Facebook\u00a0and Airbnb.\u201dBut Kloepfer\u2019s smart gun does not fire if the authorized user\u2019s finger is wet. Moreover, even when it does fire, the cycle from locked to ready to fire takes one and half seconds. One and half seconds is an eternity for an elderly person under duress or a single mom being charged by a gang of invaders in her own home.\u00a0Kloepfer showed the WSJ that if he dries his finger\u2013by rubbing it back and forth on his pants\u2013he is able to get a good read and the gun will unlock. So that\u2019s a couple of seconds drying the finger plus the one and the half seconds it takes to unlock the gun once the fingerprint is read. This is smart gun technology?WSJ asked Kloepfer if the fingerprint reader will work if the authorized user is wearing gloves or his fingers are dirty. The response was that \u201cthe first Biofire model is designed for home users, who don\u2019t often encounter these issues.\u201d Hmmmm. So now we have a smart gun that will not work if fingers are wet and is not designed for the possibly of gloves or dirty hands?The people at the Smart Gun Symposium were still excited about it.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Street8 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Luckey created Oculus Rift from a small dollar Kickstarter campaign in 2012, and then sold it two years later to Facebook for $2 billion. Since the acquisition, Luckey has become the celebrity \u201cface of virtual reality in gaming\u201d tens of thousands of first mover enthusiasts.Despite being a billionaire, Luckey\u2019s standard garb has been sandals, shorts and Hawaiian shirts at national conferences. He also lives in a shared house with several others top-ranked multiplayer videogamers.But as Breitbart News reported in late September, Luckey was outed as the anonymous billionaire behind a $10,000 donation to \u2018Nimble America\u2019, a pro-Donald Trump group that the Left claims are alt-right and white supremacy advocates. Nimble has been very active at posting negative stories about the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton online \u2013 a practice the Left calls \u201cshit-posting.\u201dA number of VR developers, including Scruta Games and Tomorrow Today Labs, have claimed they will not give their support to the roll-out of Oculus Touch as long as Luckey remains at the company. \u00a0But the loss of Luckey would also cause huge dissention from his legions of avid social media followers.Despite having to follow Google\u2019s highly-touted $79 \u201cDaydream VR\u201d fabric encrusted stand-alone peripheral for their new Pixel phone line that premiered two days earlier, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seamlessly slipped into Luckey\u2019s role to host 2,000 attendees in San Jose for the Oculus Connect 3 developer conference that began on October 6.Zuckerberg quickly crushed all the back-biting and the political friction regarding Luckey by announcing that Facebook intends to add another $250 million to the $250 million the company has already invested in developing virtual reality (VR) applications.Zuckerberg commented, \u201cWe should [all] build software and experiences that follow the way our minds work and the way we process the world.\u201d He then astounded developers by unveiling a new prototype wireless version of its\u00a0Oculus\u00a0Rift headset.The Bluetooth enabled device is Oculus\u2019 third VR and by far the most powerful device. The prototype uses a headset camera for its software to determine the position of the user within a millimeter, a technique Oculus calls \u201cinside-out tracking\u201d. Current Oculus systems rely on a much less precise system of cameras and sensors in the same room.Eric Florenzano, Oculus VR senior software engineer recruited from Twitter, commented that \u201cinside-out tracking\u201d has the potential to be an entirely new product category. He highlighted, \u201cIf the device can track your position in a room, you could leave the room where the device is and even walk outside. It starts to blur the line between virtual and augmented reality.\u201dZuckerberg demonstrated a couple of very engaging applications. AltSpace VR will allow up to eight Oculus VR users to enter in a virtual world as liquid-metal avatars. The participants can hang-out and chat, or engage in realistic play, like fencing.By adding an Oculus\u2019s Touch handset, Zuckerberg was able to mimic using a selfie stick to take a virtual reality picture of himself and his wife Priscilla Chan, then seamlessly post to Facebook with a single hand swipe.Despite Oculus only having about 1 million Oculus VR users worldwide, compared to Facebook\u2019s 1.1 billion users, Zuckerberg emphasized that virtual reality will eventually dominate social media.As a sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment to move ahead with the attendees that came to Oculus Connect 3, Zuckerberg announced that Oculus was launching a $10 million development fund at the conference to drive a rapid expansion into educational content.Breitbart California, Education, Tech, facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, Oculus Connect 3, Oculus Touch, Oculus VR, palmer luckeyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The suspect encountered Sergeant Owen, produced a handgun and opened fire, striking Sergeant Owen.\u201dThe suspect, described as a black male adult on active parole, then attempted to commandeer Owen\u2019s patrol vehicle, but was interrupted by a second deputy arriving on scene. A deputy-involved shooting ensued and the suspect rammed Owen\u2019s vehicle head-on into the assisting deputy\u2019s vehicle,\u00a0according to the LASD. The suspect then ran from the scene and entered a residence where two frightened teenagers responded by alerting the Sheriff\u2019s Department.An LASD special weapons team entered the residence in an effort to protect the teens and the suspect fled out the back door. \u201cLess-than-lethal\u201d devices were used to prevent the suspect from re-entering and the teens were rescued. The fleeing suspect breached a wall, but was caught by deputies and taken into custody. He had sustained a gunshot to the upper torso.

Mike Parker remarked of Owen\u2019s generosity that if a victim didn\u2019t have food on the table, he would put it there.Owen received the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Medal of Valor, along with other deputies, for his role in cracking a 2013 carjacking and kidnapping case, according to the Times.McDonnell said in a separate statement, \u201cThe tragedy of a deputy sheriff such as Sergeant Steve Owen making the ultimate sacrifice has a massive impact on the whole law enforcement family. We all mourn together and our hearts go out especially to Steve\u2019s immediate family Tania, a detective at Arson/Explosives Detail, his two adult sons Brandon and Chad, a step-daughter Shannon and his mother Millie.\u201dBreitbart California, Law Enforcement, Blue Lives Matter, burglary, killed, Los Angeles, medal of valor, Sheriff's Department, Steve OwenComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak7 Oct 20160Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was widely seen as the winner of the first debate, and could hurt her opponent\u2019s chances if she goads him into a serious\u00a0error or gaffe. But Republican nominee Donald Trump has bounced back in the polls, and is riding the momentum of his running mate\u2019s strong performance in the vice presidential debate. If Trump turns in a solid performance on Sunday, he could sprint to catch Clinton at the finish.The moderators of the town hall-style debate will be Martha Raddatz of ABC News and Anderson Cooper of CNN. Both lean left, and both can be expected to be tougher on Trump than on Clinton.Here are five questions that both Trump and Clinton should expect to face, either from the moderators or \u2014 in some form \u2014 from the participants in the town hall, whose questions will be pre-screened.1. With Hurricane Matthew battering the Atlantic coast, what will you do about climate change? The question makes no scientific sense, because Hurricane Matthew has nothing to do with climate change. In fact,\u00a0until this year,\u00a0no hurricanes had hit the U.S. in more than ten years, confounding the predictions of climate alarmists. But the question will be asked, and is designed to test Trump against the liberal climate orthodoxy. (Clinton\u2019s answer will be the usual boilerplate, coupled with a charge of \u201cdenialism\u201d against Trump).Trump will have to thread the needle carefully. Without denying climate change as a whole, he will have to\u00a0note that shutting down the coal industry, as Clinton wants to do, cannot be the answer. He should also note that he personally visited Louisiana this summer to visit flood victims, while Clinton hobnobbed on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.2. Both of you have high disapproval ratings. How will you be a role model for America\u2019s children? That question, or something like it, will be another veiled attack on Trump, since Clinton is a role model by default for being the first female nominee for president from a major party, no matter how poor a candidate she may be. Expect Clinton to bring out the same attack lines that\u00a0feature in her campaign commercials, and which her running mate pounded at the vice presidential debate.The question gives Trump an opportunity to score points off Clinton for her many scandals. But the best response is\u00a0for Trump\u00a0for to point to his own children\u00a0\u2014 especially his daughter Ivanka \u2014 who are successful, poised, and his best character witnesses.3. Hundreds of thousands may die in Aleppo, the latest in\u00a0a brutal\u00a0civil war. What should we do about Syria? Expect this question to come from Anderson Cooper, who likes to show his foreign policy chops. It is the question neither candidate wants to answer, since the problem cannot really\u00a0be solved short of war with Iran and confrontation with Russia. Clinton has a standard answer, which is to talk about continuing the Obama administration\u2019s fight against ISIS (such as it is). She may try to claim she wanted to do more about Syria as Secretary of State but was overruled.If she does, Trump should not let her off the hook: if she really cared about Syria, she ought to have resigned. As for his own policy, his strongest point is his criticism of Arab countries for doing everything to stoke the fighting and nothing to help the refugees.\u00a0He should pledge to stop that.4. The economy continues to create jobs, and household incomes rose last year. How will you improve on that?\u00a0In the first debate, the moderator painted a rosy picture of Obama\u2019s economic record. Clinton, who proposes to continue Obama\u2019s policies, but with an even greater focus on inequality (if that is even possible), will rattle off her talking points about raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich.Trump, who pushed back in the first debate by noting that the stock market is in a\u00a0bubble and that Clinton has never created a real job in her life, should offer a better\u00a0response this time, with three parts. First, he should talk about the Americans whom he has met on the campaign trail who are suffering in\u00a0the Obama-Clinton economy\u00a0and who are uncertain about the future. Second, he should bring up Obamacare, which has helped make this recovery the slowest since World War II, and which Clinton supports completely.\u00a0And third, he should note that Clinton\u2019s policies \u2014 higher taxes, higher fuel prices, more unskilled illegal aliens, and more needless regulations \u2014 will make the economy even worse.5. I\u2019m a veteran who lost friends in war. How can I trust either of you to be commander-in-chief? At least one question will \u2014 and probably should \u2014 go to a soldier, or a soldier\u2019s family, to present the \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d test. In this case, the question will also allow CNN and ABC to revive the Khizr Khan controversy, which marked the low point for Trump in the general election. Clinton will emphasize her experience in office, however dubious. She may even recycle her running mate\u2019s line that when she took office as Secretary of State, Osama bin Laden was still alive \u2014 to which Trump should answer: yes, and so were Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.In addition to hammering her over Benghazi, and her lies to the bereaved families, Trump should borrow his own running mate\u2019s tactics and remind Clinton\u00a0of the failed Russian \u201creset,\u201d the disaster in Iraq, and the awful Iran deal. He must also make\u00a0a promise: though he may not have served in the military, he will never sleep when there are Americans in danger, and Americans risking their lives to save them.Joel B.

Initially, she was credited with rescuing the company from a long downward spiral under several previous chief executives. However, the company\u2019s woes continued, and Mayer has failed to find a new business model for Yahoo, which is now largely focused on spinning off its core assets.Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos has been one of Mayer\u2019s more vociferous critics, calling her \u201ca symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s disastrous tokenism.\u201dYahoo has not yet responded to the lawsuit, except to defend its policies and performance reviews as fair, the\u00a0East Bay Times reports.Joel B.

Pollak7 Oct 20160The reason was simple: the people of Colombia felt their leaders had given away too much to the terrorists, denying justice to the victims and creating incentives for future terror.But no one had listened\u00a0to them. The Obama administration, for example, was heavily invested in the peace deal\u00a0as part of its outreach to the Castro regime; Kerry even witnessed the signing of the deal last month.In the U.S., one of\u00a0the few voices\u00a0against the deal was\u00a0Wall Street Journal columnist Mary Anastasia O\u2019Grady, who warned that the deal was \u201cpractically a surrender\u201d:The deal gives the FARC amnesty for its war crimes, which include the recruitment of thousands of child soldiers, massacres of villages, political executions, bombings and kidnappings.Under the agreement, negotiated and signed in Havana, the FARC will also get unelected seats in Congress and special welfare benefits. It will be given dozens of radio stations\u2014so that it can disseminate its propaganda, a privilege no other political party has.The agreement does not require the FARC to pay any financial reparations to its victims, even though the narco-terrorist kingpins have wealth estimated in the billions. Reparations will be paid by law-abiding citizens via sharp tax increases. The FARC says it will not disarm until it\u2019s good and ready to. Meanwhile it will be given weapons and training to enforce the agreement.Colombians were also angry that\u00a0President Juan Manuel Santos had taken the peace agreement to the United Nations before securing the support of the people. He declared to the UN General Assembly last month: \u201cI return to the United Nations today, on the International Day of Peace, to announce with all the strength of my voice and my heart, that the war in Colombia has ended.\u201d (Update: Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.)Yet there are two ways to end a war \u2014 through victory, or surrender. Colombians rejected the latter.O\u2019Grady notes that the Colombian government resorted to a variety of illiberal methods\u00a0to campaign for\u00a0the peace deal, such as promising\u00a0to spend government funds in areas that voted \u201cyes.\u201d The government also warned that voting \u201cno\u201d meant returning to war.Never mind that the last Colombian president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, had pushed FARC back on the battlefield, and that the rebels were weakened as a result. His successor gave those hard-fought gains\u00a0away for nothing.Now the Colombian government will return to the negotiating table \u2014 strengthened, ironically, by the fact that the people have rejected more lenient terms brokered under Havana\u2019s watchful eye. The\u00a0cease-fire with FARC could end on October 31, but the people of Colombia have faced that risk, and decided that the\u00a0price of an illusory peace was even heavier.Theirs was an extraordinarily brave decision \u2014 especially since the regions\u00a0closest to the fighting led the nation in voting \u201cno.\u201dThe Colombian people were able to exercise a choice that the American people never had when it came to the Iran deal. A new Breitbart/Gravis poll released this week confirms that the voters still reject the deal.Americans know\u00a0Iran has no desire for peace, that\u00a0the agreement allows Iran to continue its nuclear weapons program in future years, and that\u00a0the regime will cheat. Americans have consistently rejected the deal \u2014\u00a0along with its grotesque side deals, including ransoms for hostages.The Constitution requires that all treaties be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. So the Obama administration, knowing that the Senate would reject the pathetically weak terms to which it had agreed, called the Iran deal an \u201cexecutive agreement,\u201dThen Congress spoke up with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act,\u00a0demanding the power to reject the deal \u2014 while lowering the threshold for approval\u00a0to an effective one-third of either house, (which is why Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)\u00a0voted against it). That wasn\u2019t good enough for President Barack\u00a0Obama, who took the deal to the UN\u00a0Security Council first, then presented\u00a0Congress with a\u00a0fait accompli and dared it to risk war.In the end, Democrats filibustered, and there was no vote. The first time the American electorate will have a chance to speak out about the Iran deal is in the 2016 presidential election.Both Santos and Obama\u00a0sought to appease terrorism, using the UN\u00a0for\u00a0leverage against their own people. The big\u00a0difference is that Santos submitted his agreement to the voters, recognizing their sovereignty. Obama did not have the decency to do that, despite the clear intent of the Framers of the Constitution that the\u00a0people, through Congress, would decide war and peace.The recent Brexit vote did not quite involve life and death, but saw a similar pattern, where the \u201cremain\u201d campaign\u00a0tried to use\u00a0fears of economic collapse, and international leverage, to quash the voters\u2019 desire for greater sovereignty over Britain\u2019s borders and economic affairs.When treaties and transnational institutions are abused in such anti-democratic fashion, it is no surprise globalization has few defenders left, even though the benefits of (real) peace, and (truly) free trade, are\u00a0elementary.From Brexit, to the Iran deal, to \u201cpeace\u201d with\u00a0FARC, voters have been warned that rejecting the poor terms negotiated by their feckless leaders would mean disaster.The British and Colombian voters have spoken, bravely. Now, finally, Americans will have a turn.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Matthew is packing sustained winds of 145 miles-per-hour and gusts up to 165 miles-per-hour. Other big hurricanes in the past tended to roar across Florida in a four-hour period. But the slow-moving Mathew could take 60 hours to reach the Georgia border. The storm is then expected to trash the Mid-Atlantic coast at a leisurely pace, up to at least North Carolina.Total U.S. natural disaster insurance losses hit 16.1 billion in 2015, up from $15.3 billion in 2014, according to\u00a0Munich Re. Last year\u2019s major losses included: $9.6 billion from severe thunderstorms; $3.5 billion from winter storms and cold waves; and $1.9 billion from wildfires, heat waves and drought.The U.S. National Weather Service warned that Hurricane Matthew is not only packing Category 4 winds, but also brings\u00a0up to 25 foot waves, a 9-12 foot storm surge, and 40 inches of rain in some spots. The horrific combination will cause deaths, wash out roads, and cut communication links and cause outages for several weeks.Chuck Watson, disaster modeler with Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia told the Insurance Journal that the record number of emergency evacuations will cause an immense amount of business interruption insurance claims, with at least 1 million people temporarily displaced.The storm path will hit at least twelve U.S. power generators, including two nuclear plants, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nuclear operators NextEra Energy and Duke Energy Corp. have already shut their reactors. Florida Power & Light utility, the largest electric utility in Florida, estimates that up to 1.2 million customers could lose power.Although it is early in the recovery effort, there are already 261 confirmed deaths and 3,200 homes destroyed in\u00a0Hurricane Matthew\u2019s strike on Haiti.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0With NASA expected to conclude its research on the International Space Station before 2024, U.S. space travel and colonization has been turned over to private companies like SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic for the conquest of Mars.SpaceX CEO Elon Musk kicked off the land rush to Mars when he formally announced on September 26 at the 67th\u00a0International Astronautical Congress\u00a0in Guadalajara, Mexico, that he intends to \u201cMake Humans a Multi-planetary Species\u201d by having SpaceX launch the first leg of its privately funded two-year mission to Mars by 2022. Musk hilariously commented at the conference, \u201cI\u2019d like to die on Mars, just not on impact.\u201dMusk outlined that SpaceX\u00a0would soon unveil a powerful reusable rocket system called the Interplanetary Transport System\u00a0(ITS), which can carry a 100-person working crew to the \u201cRed Planet\u201d to set up permanent extraterrestrial colonies, factories and mines.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, speaking at an early October conference in Chicago, said his company was joining the land rush, and that he is \u201cconvinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,\u201d according to\u00a0Bloomberg.Boeing unveiled its heavy-lift rocket project, called the Space Launch System,\u00a0which\u00a0also aims to develop reusable rocket systems. Many aspects of Boeing\u2019s plan appear similar to SpaceX, but Muilenburg commented that his plan is a more realistic approach because it will rely on at least $60 billion in private sector satellite launches and NASA-funded development prior to a human-crewed venture to Mars in the late 2030s.NASA has essentially been operating as a joint venture in space travel with the Russians since the July 17, 1975 \u201crendezvous between the Soyuz and Apollo spacecrafts proved that the Soviet Union and the United States could set aside their differences in the name of advancing manned spaceflight,\u201d according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.The partnership allowed Washington to\u00a0curtail drastically its very expansive NASA budgets, which at the height of the Apollo program accounted for 4.2 percent of all federal budget spending. Today, that budget is less than one-half percent of federal spending.As NASA\u2019s budget declined, the U.S. space agency also struck partnership deals with other nations and the private sector to help finance research efforts. Although the U.S. continued to pay most of the cost of the International Space Station, the U.S. gained benefits, sharing the expenses with others.Historically, manned space flight has been mostly about basic research, and had few military applications. A few experiments could only be conducted in zero atmosphere, but there is no advantage to putting military special forces in space. Remote satellites are far superior to manned spacecraft for reconnaissance and imaging programs.But with the U.S. once again becoming a military and policy adversary on the world stage to the Russians and the Chinese, the importance of space as the ultimate high ground in terrestrial warfare is becoming more obvious, according to Stratfor.The U.S. has always banned Chinese scientists from working with their NASA counterparts because of national security concerns. The International Space Station required all participating nations to hand over technical information and make their hardware freely accessible to anyone involved in the program, a step China has refused to take.China, with the help of Russia, launched its second space lab into orbit in September as a preparatory step to a permanent space station in the 2020s. Russia has recently announced that it intends to separate their portion of the International Space Station modules in 2024, and then build their own outpost, or partner with the Chinese.China and Russia are focused on colonization and economic exploitation of the moon. Beijing plans to follow the model of its One Belt, One Road\u00a0strategy of using economic projects and partnerships to gain political support abroad, particularly in the developing world. Moscow\u2019s space strategy is focused on military projects and the projection of power.But NASA and the Obama administration are squarely focused on reaching the Red Planet, and will let private sector companies grab Mars as the ultimate resource platform.Big Government, Breitbart California, Tech, Apollo, boeing, China, Interplanetary Transport System, ITS, Multi-planetary Species, Russia, Soyuz, Space Launch System, SpaceX, stratforComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It\u2019s everyone who loves the idea of America. Like the Irish, for example. Or the French. Or the Brazilians. Everyone who loves the idea of America. Everyone who believes what they read at the foot of the bottom of the Statue of Liberty.\u201d\u201cGood people are not going to stay silent while you run off with the American dream!\u201d a fired-up Bono added.The band posted their own video of the Bono-Trump face-off on its Facebook page late Wednesday:According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Wednesday\u2019s \u201cDreamfest\u201d concert was held to benefit the UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital, with tickets starting at $1,000 and running all the way up to $1 million for sponsorship packages. The event was reportedly completely sold out.Bono has become an increasingly vocal critic of Trump as the election enters its final stretch.In a September interview on 60 Minutes, the rocker called the Republican candidate \u201cthe worst idea that ever happened to America,\u201d and someone who could potentially \u201cdestroy\u201d the country.The singer\u2019s name has popped up during the election in other ways; in August, emails released by Judicial Watch found that an aide to Bill Clinton petitioned the State Department to grant a request made by Bono for his upcoming world tour while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, Breitbart California, Bono, Donald Trump, Dreamforce, san francisco, Trump Wall, You're FiredComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.
