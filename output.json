She further states that the failure of Common Core developers to think through the politics of the education program allowed conservative grassroots parent and taxpayer groups to organize against it.According to the WikiLeaks email, Clinton referred to conservative parent activists who have charged that the Constitution provides for no federal role in education as those \u201cwho don\u2019t think anybody should be told anything about what to study, even if it\u2019s the multiplication tables,\u201d and who say \u201cthat should all be left to local control.\u201dClinton said:The common core is a perfect example.\u00a0I mean, the common core was negotiated by a bipartisan group of governors.\u00a0And maybe they thought \u2013 I mean, I think this was a political failure because they negotiated something and they had no real agreed-upon program for explaining it and selling it to people so that they left an opening for those who were always in the education debate, who don\u2019t think anybody should be told anything about what to study, even if it\u2019s the multiplication tables.\u00a0You know, that that should all be left to local control. And then you get into more complicated areas, as we all know, that that\u2019s just totally off limits.\u00a0 And then using common core results for teacher evaluation when everybody knew that it was going to be complicated to implement.\u201dIronically, in the same speech, Clinton also acknowledged:[U]nless you\u2019re a governor or maybe a mayor who has authority over your schools, there\u2019s not really very much that most politicians can do because of the way our system of education is governed.\u00a0Obviously, local school boards, colleges and universities, they have separate governance.\u00a0And we don\u2019t want politicians interfering too much in the independence of the governance of education.However, in a recent town hall geared to women and young people, Clinton, with her daughter Chelsea in tow, presented her view of cradle to grave federal intrusion into a \u201clife of Julia\u201d for girls and women. Clinton is a major supporter of federal assistance\u00a0for pregnancy and pre-natal care, universal pre-K, childcare, paid family leave, free college tuition and student loan forgiveness, and for single payer, government-sponsored health insurance.Clinton wants taxpayers to fund abortions for women of black and Latino ethnicity as well.Interestingly, the chancellor at University of California, Berkeley says Clinton\u2019s plan to provide free college tuition to students is a campaign pledge that is unlikely to ever be implemented.Professor Nicholas Dirks says Clinton\u2019s plan would invite unprecedented federal control over university-led research.\u201cI would love to see the Clinton administration come and make college free for students coming from families earning less than $125,000,\u201d Professor Nicholas Dirks says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\u201c[I]f such a thing came to be, there would be a real concerted effort to control parts of some of the great research institutions that are public in ways that might compromise their capacity to compete at the highest level,\u201d he added, noting as well that implementing Clinton\u2019s plan would be a \u201ccomplicated political process\u201d since state governments oversee universities.Just as with No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top \u2013 the latter of which gave us Common Core \u2013 Clinton\u2019s \u201cNew College Compact\u201d revolves around the federal government incentivizing states with federal money and perks in return for debt-free tuition for lower income students.Writing at Forbes, George Leef asserts what Dirks observes: that Hillary Clinton can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d college with more federal interference and control. Leef notes that Clinton\u2019s objective of launching more low-income students into college contains \u201ctwo mistaken beliefs\u201d: \u201cthat the cost of attending is the main reason why many students from non-wealthy families don\u2019t graduate from college and that getting a college degree would be very beneficial to them.\u201dLeef first notes that, although the cost of college has indeed risen, other low-cost options are available, such as community college \u2013 the expense for which can often be covered by Pell grants. He also says, \u201c[W]hen people shop around for higher education, almost no one is completely priced out.\u201dLeef points out, however, that cost is not the primary reason lower income students don\u2019t seek out college.\u201cThe main reason why most don\u2019t enroll isn\u2019t the cost, but rather because they aren\u2019t academically prepared for or (even if academically prepared) interested in devoting more years of their lives to formal schooling,\u201d he says. \u201cTrying to lure such individuals into college with free tuition is a bad idea.\u201dUnlike Clinton \u2013 who continually urges more federal spending in education as the nation\u2019s best \u201cinvestment\u201d \u2013 Leef states, \u201cThe economy does not automatically create more \u2018good jobs\u2019 simply because more college graduates enter the labor market.\u201d\u201cGovernment policy aimed at \u2018producing\u2019 more graduates will only mean more young people who are over-credentialed for the work available,\u201d he explains. \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t have a shortage of people with college degrees. What it does have is a shortage of jobs that pay well.

My thoughts are with the families and friends of all victims, and I hope for a full and speedy recovery of the wounded,\u201d Mladenov wrote.\u201cIt is deplorable and unacceptable that Hamas and others choose to glorify such acts which undermine the possibility of a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis,\u201d he added.Israeli watchdog group Palestinian Media Watch reported that the Fatah party posted on its Facebook page an announcement saying, \u201cThe one who carried out the operation today in Jerusalem is a pilgrim [to Mecca] Martyr.\u201dThe Jerusalem branch of the Fatah party posted a message announcing a general strike and mourning \u201cin memory of the souls of the Martyrs of Palestine and this morning\u2019s Martyr.\u201dThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement also hailed the attack as \u201cheroic.\u201dAccording to independent Palestinian news agency Ma\u2019an, the terrorist responsible for the attack was slated to turn himself in to prison at that exact time after being convicted and sentenced to four months in jail for assaulting a Jerusalem police officer in 2013.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Fatah, Funeral, glorifying terror, Hebrew Univeristy, honoring martyrs, Israel, Israel-Arab conflict, Jerusalem shooting attack, Palestinian Authority, Palestinian Terrorism, President Mahmoud Abbas, TerroristsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

And the question is why not?\u201d said Channel 2\u2019s veteran police reporter Moshe Nussbaum. \u201cMaybe, and I say this cautiously, but maybe he could have been stopped.\u201dJerusalem\u2019s police chief Yoram Halevy defended the police\u2019s inaction by saying only that they were monitoring \u201cmany potential attackers\u201d and the terrorist was \u201cone of those who certainly had the potential\u201d to carry out an attack.Halevy added that the attack could have been far worse were it not for heavy police presence in the area. The terrorist allegedly used an IDF issue M-16 machine-gun with \u201clots and lots of ammunition,\u201d he said, and had he made it to the center of town, \u201che would have killed lots of people.\u201dHowever, Ya\u2019ari maintained that the killer\u2019s rap sheet \u2013 including his renown as an inciter and the fact that he has been barred from the Temple Mount \u2013 should have kept the police on their toes. However, Israel\u2019s security apparatus, Ya\u2019ari said, did not think the terrorist was \u201cabout to make the transition from\u00a0using his fists to using a machine-gun.\u201dYnet news reported that blame for the attack also lay with Israel\u2019s justice system. The terrorist should have already been in jail, but in 2015 his sentence was postponed despite having repeatedly failed to show up in court.The terrorist told independent Palestinian news agency Ma\u2019an that he was intending to report to Ramle prison at 10am Sunday, the exact time he launched his killing spree.According to the report, failure to do so would mean facing imprisonment without trial.In the interview, the terrorist said he had been detained and released five times in the past two weeks, and was barred from entering east Jerusalem for a month.The attacker had been indicted on 15 counts of incitement to violence, and seven counts of supporting a terror organization, Channel 10 reported.Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan blamed social media sites like Facebook for not removing his posts, saying there was a direct link between the social media giant and terrorism.\u201cFacebook and other social media have a direct responsibility,\u201d Erdan said after touring the site of Sunday\u2019s attack. He added that it was \u201cscandalous\u201d that Facebook had restored numerous Hamas-linked Facebook pages in the past two weeks \u201cbecause of Palestinian public pressure.\u201dBig Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, glorifying terror, honoring martyrs, Israel police, Israel-Arab conflict, Jerusalem shooting attack, Justice System, Palestinian Authority, Palestinian Terrorism, TerroristsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Twelve minutes? Whatever it was, of discussion of this ridiculous tape. Then it was clear as a bell that Donald Trump finally took control of the debate and the future of America and absolutely, in my view, wiped the floor with Hillary Clinton last night.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little bit of an outlier on this issue, of this tape and what he said,\u201d Klein conceded. \u201cYeah, it was crude. Yeah, it was vulgar. But you know, in my many, many years on this planet, I\u2019ve heard from many men in public office a lot worse than what he said on that tape. And men do speak that way. He is right. It is locker talk.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happened in this country, however, is that this kind of talk that\u2019s gone on for centuries, I would go so far as to say, is no longer politically correct because of the feminization of our culture,\u201d Klein contended. \u201cAnd the fact that men who talk this way are somehow completely discredited, even though it is a centuries-old kind of banter, and boisterousness, and, quite frankly, boasting of prowess that quite frankly isn\u2019t true.\u201d\u201cDid it make Donald Trump look kind of bad? Yes, of course it did. But the very people, including many, many Republicans, who got on their high horse, their self-righteous high horses about this, are the same guys who turn on pornography when they are traveling in Marriott hotels, and who often sleep with their secretaries on Capitol Hill, and do many more, worse things than Donald Trump has done in his life,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that Donald is pure as the driven snow. Donald himself would admit that he\u2019s far from pure as the driven snow \u2026 and quite frankly, even you and I right now are spending too much time on it,\u201d Klein told Marlow. \u201cWhat we saw last night was a huge, in my view, huge comeback by Donald Trump. Now, we\u2019ll see whether it\u2019s reflected in the polls. I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t think you and I can predict this. But certainly, he gave a masterful, masterful performance, and she was on her heels all night long.\u201dKlein thought Clinton\u2019s low-key performance during the second debate was interesting, given that she\u2019s spent \u201chundreds, if not thousands, of hours preparing for these debates, and is good at this kind of stuff \u2013 good at preparing, good at memorizing. She does her homework.\u201d\u201cBut, for whatever reasons, she was not ready for Donald last night,\u201d he judged. \u201cThere was this other thing that the New York Post captured on the front page of its paper today, which is his looming presence onstage while she was talking. He never sat down, as far as I can remember. He was pacing like a caged lion most of the time and while she was talking he was standing behind her, powerfully bigger and stronger than she, visually. I think that had an impact, too. It wasn\u2019t bullying. It wasn\u2019t like a man bullying a woman, quote-unquote. It was a simple visual of who has, as Pence would say, the broad shoulders, the power, the strength to lead this country, at a time when we need to shake things up, from the bottom up.\u201dKlein, having chronicled Bill Clinton\u2019s ongoing objectionable behavior in Guilty as Sin, was impressed by the sight of the women who accused him of harassment and assault sitting in the audience for the debate.\u201cI have a whole chapter on Bill Clinton\u2019s current \u2013 not back in the 1990s when he raped and harassed and intimidated women, not 20 or 30 years ago \u2013 we\u2019re talking about right now, Bill Clinton is continuing his exploitation of 20-year-old interns at his library in Little Rock,\u201d said Klein. \u201cI did not see one mainstream media outlet pick this up \u2013 or, for that matter, even check to see if I was accurate. Of course, I think I\u2019m accurate because I interviewed the girls who did the foot rubs, and I interviewed the man who was at his party when he hosed down the women in this wet T-shirt contest. But nobody in the media has bothered to check and find out what I did, by simply going down to Little Rock and asking questions.\u201d\u201cSo you can see this disgusting double standard that we are living with in this country, at a time when we can no longer afford to avoid truth,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe truth of the Islamicization of the Western world, our economy going down the tubes, our position in the world \u2013 look at what happened just yesterday. The Philippines, of all places, the president of the Philippines says he wants to get out of the American orbit and into the Chinese orbit. I mean, that is breathtaking\u00a0when you stop to think about it.\u201dKlein described a difference of opinion between himself and Trump on the issue of jailing Hillary Clinton: \u201cYes, she\u2019s guilty as sin. Yes, she deserved to be indicted. Yes, a grand jury should have been empaneled, and I thought she would have been found guilty and fined and maybe jailed, or at least fined at the very, very, very least, for jeopardizing national security \u2013 for going to Moscow and Beijing with her little Blackberry that was unsecure.\u201dHowever, he said he thought that if Trump were\u00a0elected President, \u201che\u2019s got a lot of important things to do, very important things to do, and he needs to get them done with the Congress,\u201d so appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton would \u201cbe a diversion from what is needed right now, which is to get the economy going again, lowering taxes, vetting immigration, as he says, building that wall, and bringing back America\u2019s leadership to the rest of the world.\u201d\u201cIf he gets sidetracked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s past, as egregious and terrible and dangerous as it was, I think that would be a mistake,\u201d Klein opined.When Marlow suggested that Trump might not really be looking to prosecute Clinton, but raised the possibility as a \u201cnegotiating tactic\u201d and an effort to \u201creset the conversation,\u201d Klein agreed that such an approach would be \u201cvery Trump-like\u201d \u2013 an example of \u201cgetting the best deal possible.\u201d\u201cGetting the best deal possible means having to work with your opponents, as well as your friends,\u201d Klein noted.He said Republicans who swiftly abandoned Trump after the tape of his 11-year-old vulgar comments surfaced \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\u201cI mean, they jumped off the bandwagon like a bunch of rats jumping off a sinking ship,\u201d said Klein. \u201cAnd now they look back over their shoulder and see that Donald not only won the debate last night, but in my view, at least to a certain degree \u2013 I don\u2019t know to what degree, we\u2019ll find out in the polls \u2013 reset the election. And here they are, all of them, you know, in opposition to their candidate. I think they look ridiculous. And there\u2019s nothing much they can do about it, at this point, I suppose.

Heller was a reaffirmation that the Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment to protect a fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.Clinton\u2019s disagreement with the Heller decision runs so deep that she twice refused to admit the right to bear arms is constitutional during the June 5 airing of This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u00a0When Stephanopoulos first asked her if the right to bear arms is constitutional, she would only obfuscate, saying:I think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment, until the decision by the late Justice [Antonin] Scalia. And there was no argument until then that localities, and states, and the federal government had a right\u2013as we do with every amendment\u2013to impose reasonable regulations.Stephanopoulos followed up, pressing her to give a direct answer as to whether the right to bear arms is constitutional. Clinton said, \u201cIf it is a constitutional right, then it\u2013like every constitutional right\u2013is subject to reasonable regulation.\u201dAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

According to my information, 40 to 50 percent of the force did not exist physically when we asked for help during operations,\u201d he explained. \u201cSalaries of ghost soldiers had been received during the past eight months and the money has gone to personal accounts.\u201dFurthermore, the governor of Helmand also noted that \u201cthere are ghost soldiers within the security forces in Helmand\u201d and that officials there have \u201cdiscovered at least 400 and scrapped them from the list.\u201dIn April 2015, SIGAR reported that Inaccurate and unreliable data on Afghan security personnel may place America\u2019s security and billions of U.S. taxpayer funds at risk, adding that the United States has spent nearly $70 billion to recruit, train, equip, house, feed, supply, and pay the salaries\u201d of the ANDSF, including those of \u201chollow\u201d Afghan brigades that do not really exist.The Pentagon refused to comment on whether the Obama administration is concerned about \u201cghost\u201d Afghan troops receiving U.S. taxpayer funds, jeopardizing U.S. gains, and placing American military troops at risk.

The gift also funds new scholarships and professorships at the law school.Justice Elena Kagan, the newest member of the Court, spoke on behalf of the entire Court at the dedication ceremony, lauding her departed colleague as a \u201cremarkable judge and teacher.\u201dScalia \u201cwill go down in history as one of the most important Supreme Court justices ever, and one of the greatest,\u201d Kagan declared. \u201cHe did nothing less than transform our legal culture.\u201dThe five other justices of the High Court present for the ceremony were Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor.Kagan\u2019s participation was rich with symbolism in at least two regards. First, as an appointee of a liberal Democrat, Kagan\u2019s warm and generous praise highlighted the camaraderie of the justices and the status they aspire to as a nonpolitical branch of government.Second, like Scalia, Kagan was a prominent law professor before being appointed to the bench. In fact, Kagan was the dean of Harvard Law School, the school where she earned her law degree and which was Scalia\u2019s alma mater, as well. (Scalia received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown.) So Kagan\u2019s approval carries with it the applause of academia, in recognition of Scalia\u2019s epic impact on legal philosophy.Scalia was a champion of originalism\u2013that in our democratic form of government, the Constitution requires that all laws (including the Constitution itself) must be interpreted according to the original public meaning of their\u00a0words, which would have been the meaning approved by the American people in adopting those words.Kagan knew Scalia before she\u00a0joined the Court from his trips to Harvard Law School during her tenure as dean. After Kagan\u2019s confirmation, Scalia became a close friend, taking her on hunting trips and other activities that were new experiences for Kagan. This outreach reflected Scalia\u2019s approach to life and the ease with which he made friends, also seen in his close friendship with archliberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who shared a love of opera with Scalia.University President Angel Cabrera and law school dean Henry Butler also participated in the naming ceremony.Antonin Scalia passed away in his sleep during the nighttime hours of February 12 this year.

But it also showed that Trump exceeded expectations, which impressed undecided voters.Frank Luntz\u2019s focus group of undecided voters on Fox News saw a massive shift away from Clinton and towards Trump, prompting him to declare: \u201cTonight was so significant that Trump is back in this race.\u201dPollsters and pundits debate whether presidential debates actually affect the outcome of elections. Republicans took heart in 2012 when challenger Mitt Romney handily defeated President Barack Obama in their first debate. But the Obama campaign\u2019s data mining team claimed to have the election in the bag already, and Romney\u2019s poor performance in the remaining debates may simply have sealed his defeat.Still, Trump\u2019s strong showing on Sunday left a far different impression than Romney\u2019s performance in the second debate in 2012, when he yielded to Obama and moderator Candy Crowley on the Benghazi issue.The Las Vegas debate will be the candidates\u2019 last chance to make a strong impression on voters on a national stage. Once again, Trump will likely enjoy the benefit of low expectations, since the media are determined to deny him an outright victory in the second contest.But Las Vegas is home turf for Trump, and a gambling city loves the underdog.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing.The pro-Western kingdom sealed its border with Syria in June, after a deadly cross-border attack claimed by Islamic State extremists killed seven members the Jordanian security forces. This has left more than 75,000 Syrians stuck between a war zone and a sealed border, without regular access to food, water and medicine.The displaced live in two makeshift tent camps in an area where the frontier is marked by two parallel low earthen walls, or berms. Conditions have become increasingly dire, with aid officials reporting the spread of disease, including whooping cough and hepatitis.Before the border closure, aid was sent from Jordanian soil. In August, Jordan permitted an aid drop by crane, in what was described at the time as a one-off shipment.U.N. agencies have since proposed setting up an aid distribution center between five and seven kilometers west of the largest encampment, known as Rukban, within the strip marked by the two berms, an aid official said. This would presumably have drawn the Syrians away from a Jordanian military base that is close to Rukban.However, Momani told The Associated Press on Monday that this is no longer being considered.\u201cThe new mechanism will be delivering aid on the berm through cranes, and the aid will be given to community leaders of groups of Syrians so they can distribute it accordingly,\u201d he said, adding it would be up to the aid agencies to decide on the pace of shipments.Momani said the border will remain sealed, citing an ongoing security threat to Jordan. The camps at the berm have been infiltrated by criminals, smugglers and extremists, he said.\u201cYou can describe part of it as a Daesh enclave,\u201d he said, referring to the extremist Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym.The two aid officials said nothing has been agreed on. One of the officials, who has direct access to the talks, said he was not aware of an emerging agreement on crane drops. He said another meeting was set for Tuesday.The suffering at the berm has caused some friction between Jordan and the international community.Aid agencies have been pressing for a resumption of aid from the Jordanian side.Jordan has said the international community needs to take responsibility for those stranded at the berm, and that the kingdom has already done more than its share in taking in Syrian refugees. In the past, Jordan has argued that this aid needs to come from Syrian territory, not Jordan.Momani said Jordan has taken the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d by offering to help.Close to 5 million Syrians fled civil war in their country since 2011, including close to 660,000 who settled in Jordan.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Daesh, Islamic State, Jordan, Mohammed Momani, Rukban, Syria civil warComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

From the pre-debate, and through the debate.\u201d(CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, had just compared Trump to Hitler and Stalin in expressing her outrage that Hillary Clinton might be held to the same legal standard as every other American who is entrusted with classified information.)Finally, CNN anchor Jake Tapper weighted in: \u201cIm sure he will win every online poll. I know that the Breitbart crowd ate this up. My question is: did he win over any suburban households in Philadelphia?\u201dHis co-panelist, CNN contributor and conservative author Jeffrey Lord, said that he thought Trump had, in fact, won support among those voters with his performance.Joel B.

I\u2019m not sure any minds were changed at this debate tonight. I think so much has occurred over the last 48 hours and this last week\u00a0that people have\u00a0to digest all of this, including the debate tonight, to see where they stand.\u201d Co-panelist Mike Smerconish declared Trump the winner \u201con points\u201d: \u201cI think the night belongs to Donald Trump,\u201d he said. But Smerconish\u00a0added that Trump had fallen short, regardless: \u201cDid he grow the tent? I can\u2019t see that there was any outreach.\u201dTrump beat Clinton despite facing a three-on-one press from his opponent and from the moderators, who were at least as biased as they had been in any of the previous debates. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper fired repeated follow-ups at Trump while leaving Clinton largely alone. But he, at least, brought up tough questions for Clinton on occasion.\u00a0ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz actively debated Trump at times, and silenced the audience when it cheered for Trump \u2014 though not for Clinton.Still, Trump overcame that hostility and pressed Clinton effectively on the issues, as well as on her weakest points \u2014 the email scandal, Benghazi, and Obamacare. He was on better ground than Clinton when it came to citing facts, and he forced her into repeating the rather serious lie that the only emails she deleted from her private server were personal in nature. He also stood his ground on substantive policy questions while maintaining his cool \u2014 for the most part \u2014 when she tried\u00a0personal attacks.The media had largely\u00a0declared the presidential race for Hillary Clinton Saturday, after many Republicans criticized Trump over comments he made in 2005 about groping women. The comments were captured by a live mic and surfaced Friday. Chuck Todd, political director of NBC News, said \u201cthe presidential race is over,\u201d according to Republicans with whom he spoke. Despite Trump\u2019s debate win, the media will be\u00a0reluctant\u00a0to let go of that narrative, with many cheering for his demise.At the first debate, Trump refrained from placing any of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety in the front row, despite threatening to do so. This time, with the media and the Hillary Clinton campaign hitting Trump over his old remarks, Trump more than delivered on the threat, holding a press conference with four of Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers \u2014 who also accused Hillary Clinton of trying to silence and slander them \u2014 before the debate, and placing them in the front row.The Donald Trump that debated Hillary Clinton in St. Louis was better prepared, more passionate, and more focused on the issues than he was two weeks ago. He won, under incredible pressure.The voters will see it, even if the media will not.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Huntingdon, of \u201cClash of Civilizations\u201d fame\u00a0and a life-long Democrat and foreign policy hawk.Huntington noted in 2004 that the global elites \u201chave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations\u201d.CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT\u00a0FOR PEACEFP was bought by the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, a globalist think tank founded by internationalist Andrew Carnegie. To give further context to this, the current President is\u00a0William J. Burns \u2013 the former\u00a0United States Deputy Secretary of State (2011-14). In other words, he worked for Hillary Clinton.WASHINGTON POST\u00a0Carnegie sold FP to the Washington Post group in 2008.When the\u00a0Washington Post \u2013 which has been an integral media ally of the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2013 bought FP, it was losing around $1.3m a year. But it was considered so integral to helping push a neoconservative, hawkish foreign policy, that it was worth the loss.The chairman of the Washington Post group in 2008 was Donald E. Graham, who said of the acquisition: \u201cForeign Policy is a terrific magazine, and I\u2019m pleased it will become a part of our company\u2026 Foreign Policy furthers our commitment to great magazine journalism and gives us another opportunity to expand our journalism online\u201d.SLATE GROUPIn 2008, Foreign Policy was moved into the Slate group, the home of the left-wing Slate magazine.Slate\u2019s editor in chief is Jacob Weisberg, an NPR contributor, left-wing New Republic contributor, New York Times contributor, contributing editor to Vanity Fair, and columnist for the Financial Times.FP Group\u2019s Media Kit promotes Hillary Clinton as its foremost recent contributorGRAHAM HOLDINGS COMPANYWhen Amazon owner Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, he did not buy the loss-making Foreign Policy magazine with its declining readership. Alexa.com, which is a site ranking organisation run by Amazon itself, reveals Foreign Policy to be the\u00a09719th website in the world compared to its competitor the Economist, which is the\u00a01,935th website.Instead, the magazine stayed with the aforementioned Donald Graham, who changed the name of the Washington Post group to Graham Holdings Company to reflect the sale of the paper.The magazine now operates under the FP Group, headed up by David Rothkopf.Rothkopf, to square FP\u2019s historical circle, is a scholar of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. He was a managing director at Kissinger Associates,\u00a0former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\u2019s New York-based consulting firm which was founded alongside\u00a0Mack McLarty, President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff.But greater still, Rothkopf himself served as U.S. Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade under\u00a0the Clinton Administration in 1993, when Mr. Clinton was signing NAFTA\u00a0which Donald Trump has pledged to reform.DONALD E. GRAHAMGraham, the Chairman and CEO of the company that owns Foreign Policy magazine, is married to Amanda Bennett, a Bloomberg journalist who has just moved to Voice of America.In 2014, the pair founded a \u201cmultimillion dollar National Scholarship Fund\u201d for the children of illegal immigrants in the United States.The organisation has solicited large donations from many Hillary Clinton supporters such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Fernandez Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and a whopping $5m from Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg.\u2018BREAKING WITH TRADITION\u2019Foreign Policy magazine\u2019s claim to be \u201cbreaking with tradition\u201d in endorsing Hillary Clinton is anything but accurate.Perhaps it has never written an editorial, but its entire editorial line and history is, in and of itself, a tradition of endorsing globalist, neoconservative, pro open borders policies and candidates.The idea that this is somehow a big deal is a total farce.Follow Raheem Kassam on Twitter2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, carnegie endowment for peace, david e graham, foreign policy, Hillary Clinton, Slate, Washington PostComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

LOUIS, Missouri0ST. LOUIS, Missouri \u2014 Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, appeared with three alleged sexual assault victims of former President Bill Clinton in the hours before he debates Clinton\u2019s wife, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, here at Washington University. The women\u2014Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick\u2014have each leveled various charges against Bill Clinton. They also each have charged that Hillary Clinton was an \u201cenabler\u201d of Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior in exclusive interviews with Breitbart News\u2019 Aaron Klein published on Sunday.In addition, Kathy Shelton\u2014who was allegedly raped when she was 12 years old, while Hillary Clinton defended her accused rapist\u2014spoke as well.Before the event started, a leftist\u00a0reporter\u00a0yelled at Trump: \u201cMr. Trump, does your star power allow you to touch women without their consent?\u201dThen Trump, ignoring the reporter, opened the panel event and said: \u201cThank you very much for coming, and these four very courageous women have asked to be here and it was our honor to help them. I think we\u2019re each going to make just an individual short statement, and then we will have a little meeting and we will see you at the debate.\u201dWATCH THE VIDEO:Jones, who kicked it off, said, \u201cI\u2019m here to support Mr. Trump because he\u2019s going to make America great again, and I think everybody else should vote for him.\u201cI think they should all look at the fact that he is a good person, he\u2019s not what other people have been saying he\u2019s been, not Hillary\u2014so think about that,\u201d Jones said.Shelton then said, \u201cI\u2019m also here to support Trump.\u201d She stated that \u201cat 12 years old, Hillary put me through something that you would never put a 12-year-old through.\u201d\u201cShe says she\u2019s for women and children,\u201d Shelton added, noting that Hillary Clinton stands against women and children because she was caught \u201claughing on tape\u201d last year when asked about her case.Broaddrick went next. \u201cI\u2019m here to support Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI tweeted recently, and Mr. Trump retweeted it, that actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump may have said some bad words but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any comparison.\u201dWilley, who was the last to speak on the short panel, noted as well that \u201cI am here to support Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cThe reason for that is the first day that he announced for president he said, \u2018I love this country and I want America to be great again.\u2019 And I cried when he said that because I think this is the greatest country in the world,\u201d Willey said. \u201cI think that we can do anything. I think we can accomplish anything. I think that he can bring peace to this world. And I think Donald Trump can lead us to that point.\u201dWhen Trump wrapped the event, which was broadcast live on his Facebook page, the same reporter shouted more questions.\u201cMr. Trump, have you touched women without their consent?\u201d the reporter shouted multiple times.Jones, after the reporter wouldn\u2019t stop harassing Trump and the panel, fired back: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask Bill Clinton that? Why don\u2019t y\u2019all go ask Bill Clinton that? Go ahead\u2014ask Hillary as well.\u201dThe room erupted in applause for Jones.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, kathy shelton, Paula JonesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The overall trade deficit, including both goods and services, was lower at $500 billion. Trump has generally focused more on the deficit in goods, and the difficulty it represents for America\u2019s manufacturing sector.\nby Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUE\u201cWhen I\u00a0look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided\u00a0transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state \u2013 really, the number one terrorist state,\u201d Trump told the audience, responding to a question from the audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve made them a strong country from, really, a very weak\u00a0country just three years ago.\u201dTrump has made this claim regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), as the Iran nuclear deal is officially known, and received some criticism for it. Fact-checking websites such as Politifact have argued that Trump\u2019s claim is false because \u201cthe money is already Iran\u2019s to begin with,\u201d but not denied that this amount of money would return to the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei thanks to the deal.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0has argued that the $150 billion estimate is a fabrication by \u201ccongressional Republicans\u201d far from the real amount of money Iran would once again control.As\u00a0Algemeiner,\u00a0citing\u00a0Omri Ceren of the Israel Project, notes, the twelve-figure estimate of the money the deal would return to Iranian control came from President Barack Obama, not Republicans. President Obama\u00a0said in an interview\u00a0that Iran \u201chas $150 billion parked outside the country,\u201d arguing that not all of its funds under sanctions will be unfrozen immediately because \u201cunwinding the existing restraints\u2026 takes a certain amount of time.\u201dThis money does not include a separate\u00a0$1.7 billion\u00a0payment to the government of Iran, allegedly to atone for an arms sales agreement that never went through after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\u00a0The U.S. government\u00a0handed over that money\u00a0the same day that Iran released several American citizens imprisoned on dubious charges.Both\u00a0President Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Secretary of State John Kerry, who played a major role in brokering the Iran nuclear deal, have admitted that the Iranian regime will likely use the money to fund terrorism, particularly activity by the Shiite terrorist organization Hezbollah.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEBill Clinton was indeed impeached for lying under oath to a grand jury and obstructing justice, although he was not removed from office.After impeachment, Bill Clinton was held in contempt of court by federal Judge Susan Webber Wright, in what the New York Times described as a \u201cscathing\u201d ruling. Wright said Clinton testified falsely in his deposition about not having sex with Monica Lewinsky, and that his actions \u201csubverted the rule of law and violated Ms. Jones\u2019s right to information relevant to her case.\u201d\u201cThe court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation\u2019s President in contempt of court,\u201d Wright wrote. However, she added, \u201cthe record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiffs\u2019 questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process.\u201dClinton\u2019s law license in Arkansas was suspended for five years, and he paid a $25,000 fine. The Supreme Court also barred Clinton from practicing law before the nation\u2019s highest court.Trump made a reference to an $850,000 fine Bill Clinton paid to Paula Jones. This was, in fact, an out-of-court\u00a0settlement Clinton reached with Jones, not a fine leveled by the court.\u00a0The purpose of reaching an out-of-court settlement is to avoid an unpleasant trial that could very well end with even worse consequences, so Trump is basically correct that Clinton\u2019s conduct cost him $850,000, and he didn\u2019t want to pay it \u2013 it most certainly was not a charitable contribution! \u2013 but it technically wasn\u2019t a \u201cfine.\u201dby Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE.Just two days ago, Trump apologized publicly for comments he made on a video recorded 2005 in which he joked about groping women.\u00a0It is true that Trump tends to avoid apologizing, and that he did not apologize in some of the cases that Clinton mentioned.\u00a0He did not apologize for the Birther controversy, for example \u2014 though he has maintained that there is no need to do so, because he provoked President Barack Obama into finally producing his long-form birth certificate.Occasionally, Trump offers a sarcastic apology \u2014 as he did when he \u201capologized\u201d to Pocahontas for using her name to ridicule Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who allegedly faked Native American heritage to obtain a professorship at Harvard Law School.\u00a0And in August, he expressed \u201cregret\u201d for some of the things he had said that had offended people (including, presumably, the Khizr Khan episode, which Clinton mentioned). He avoided saying the word \u201capologize.\u201dStill, the claim that Trump \u201cnever\u201d apologizes is incorrect.by Katie McHugh9 Oct 2016\u201cOne of them is a wonderful woman, [who] at 12 years old was raped. At twelve. Her client \u2014 she represented \u2014 got him off, laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl that was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight. So, don\u2019t tell me about words,\u201d Trump said. \u00a0Fact-Check: TRUEIn the mid-1980s, journalist Roy Reed interviewed Hillary Clinton, and\u00a0a tape of that interview has been uploaded to YouTube and is available in the Special Collections Department of the University of Arkansas libraries.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe took a lie detector test! I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,\u201d Clinton said about her client Thomas Alfred Taylor, who raped Shelton in 1975, laughing.\u00a0Clinton\u00a0also laughed in the video about saving the child rapist from a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d He served one year in county jail, with two months shaved off his sentence for the time he already served. Shelton\u2019s injuries were so traumatic, she could never have children.\u00a0WATCH:\u00a0Clinton also argued in court that the 12-year-old rape victim sought out older men.\u00a0Shelton came forward after 40 years of silence, as reported by the Daily Mail:\u00a0A child rape victim says she cannot forgive Hillary Clinton for defending her rapist in court 40 years ago, saying the Democratic presidential candidate attacked her credibility despite knowing that her assailant was guilty \u2013 and later laughed about it in a taped interview.Kathy Shelton was just 12 years old when a 41-year-old drifter raped her on the side of a desolate Arkansas road in 1975.Now, four decades later, she has agreed to be named and pictured for the first time in this Daily Mail Online exclusive because she is furious that her rapist\u2019s defense attorney \u2013 Hillary Clinton \u2013 has been portraying herself as a lifelong advocate of women and girls on the campaign trail.\u2018It\u2019s put a lot of anger back in me,\u2019 said Shelton, now 54, in an exclusive interview at her Springdale, Arkansas, home in August. \u2018Every time I see [Clinton] on TV I just want to reach in there and grab her, but I can\u2019t do that.\u2019In 1975, Clinton served as the defense lawyer for Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old factory worker accused of raping Shelton after luring her to his car.Taylor pleaded down to \u2018unlawful fondling of a minor\u2019 and served less than a year in prison after Clinton was able to block the admission of forensic evidence that linked her client to the crime.Shelton also tweeted about her suffering at Hillary\u2019s hands.I don\u2019t care if Trump said gross things. I care that Hillary Clinton lied, terrorized, & mocked me, defending my rapist.\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016Hillary Clinton an advocate for women & children? Not even close.. She terrorized me during my rape case & later laughed about it. #facts\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016If I\u2019d had justice vs my rapist, maybe I could have healed. But Hillary Clinton made sure I suffered loss of justice, then laughed it off.\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016Hillary Clinton is a cold-hearted liar. The lies she told about me, 12 yr old rape victim, traumatized me nearly as much as the rape itself.\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016No little girl should suffer violent rape like I did\u2026But no grown woman should attack that little girl like @HillaryClinton did. #debate\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 10, 2016At 12 I was one of the first women Hillary Clinton destroyed, but I wasn\u2019t the last. Please put an end to this woman\u2019s career of abusing us.\u2014 Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 10, 2016by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSE.Capt. Khan was an Army officer who gave his life defending fellow soldiers in Iraq, and whose parents attacked Trump in a speech at the Democratic National Convention.When asked about the speech by ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos (a former aide to President Bill Clinton), Trump made a comment about the silence of Khan\u2019s mother, who stood mute onstage alongside Khan\u2019s father.But Trump never said anything negative at all about Capt. Khan, and in fact praised his sacrifice on nearly every occasion.\u00a0Trump reiterated his praise for the late Capt. Khan in his rebuttal to Clinton: \u201cCaptain Khan is an American hero.\u201dby John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUEThe recently-leaked transcripts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches have her speaking supportively of single-payer systems, although in her public campaign pronouncements, she emphasizes \u201cfixing\u201d the problems with the Affordable Care Act. Some examples:\u201cIf you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don\u2019t have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.\u201d (June 2013)\u201cSo we\u2019re in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you\u2019re going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what\u2019s succeeding, fix what isn\u2019t, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.\u201d (January 2015)What Clinton says in public is often very different than what she tells her private speaking audiences. For example, she recently said she thought single-payer would \u201cnever, ever happen,\u201d but she was making a prediction and saying that ObamaCare repairs couldn\u2019t wait for a single-payer system to be created, not expressing her own policy preference: \u201cI want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act. I don\u2019t want it repealed, I don\u2019t want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don\u2019t want us to end up in gridlock. People can\u2019t wait! People who have health emergencies can\u2019t wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.\u201dDuring Clinton\u2019s primary run against Bernie Sanders, the New York Times found her moving to the left on health care and saying she was \u201cin favor of what\u2019s called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age.\u201d Sanders was explicitly in favor of single-payer health care\u2026 and described it as \u201cMedicare for all.\u201dby Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSE.\u00a0According to FBI Director James Comey, \u201cthe FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not among the group of 30,000 e-mails returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.\u201d\u00a0Federal investigators concluded\u00a0that Clinton\u2019s lawyers deleted nearly half of the 60,000 emails on her server.\u00a0by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: HALF TRUETrump was answering a question about Islamophobia, and while he acknowledged that prejudice against Muslims is a problem, he argued that political correctness places American lives at risk.\u00a0\u00a0He cited the neighbors of the San Bernardino terrorists \u2014 and he was correct to do so, because they did tell reporters after the attack that they had seen unusual activity, but chose not to report it for fear of being accused of racial profiling.However, the neighbors did not actually see \u201cbombs\u201d (though that was, in fact, what the San Bernardino terrorists were building in their home).So while Trump\u2019s statement about political correctness was essentially true, he was incorrect about the details.by Katie McHugh9 Oct 2016Clinton stated during the debate:\u201cI will not let anyone into the country that I think will poses a risk to us, but there are a lot\u00a0 refugees, women and children\u2026 There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely I believe because of Russian aggression, and we need to do our part. We are by no means carrying anywhere near the load Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be, from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\u201dFact-Check: FALSE (According to Clinton herself)\u00a0The Wikileaks dump revealed that Clinton herself said refugees \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d be vetted, as Breitbart News reported:\u00a0Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign to reconcile the differences between Secretary Clinton\u2019s 2013 private remarks, where she said Syrian refugees \u201ccan\u2019t possibly\u201d be vetted, to her 2015 and 2016 campaign claims that \u201cvigilant\u201d screening and \u201cvetting\u201d of \u201crefugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,\u201d will be sufficient to safeguard American citizens from \u201cjihadists coming in along with legitimate refugees,\u201d but there has not yet been a response.We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Secretary Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan, which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees; she admits we cannot.The entire quote from Clinton\u2019s speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago\u2019s Vanguard Luncheon on October 28, 2013, included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches reads as follows:\u201cSo I think you\u2019re right to have gone to the places that you visited because there\u2019s a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it\u2019s on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can\u2019t possibly vet all those refugees so they don\u2019t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cTurkey for the same reason.\u201d\u00a0In September, a top Obama immigration official also admitted to Congress that some refugees launch terrorist plots after they\u2019ve been \u201cvetted\u201d and invited into the United States.\u00a0by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUEThis is an extremely difficult statement to fact-check, because a great deal depends on what is meant by \u201creforming the tax code.\u201d A thorough rundown of Clinton\u2019s voting records on tax issues prepared by Forbes in April 2015 reveals little in Senator Clinton\u2019s record that could be fairly described as a significant reform.In summary, Clinton voted against the Bush tax cuts, but voted for a few amendments to the bill that did not pass; she eventually voted yes to extend those tax cuts, while complaining that she thought they benefited the wealthy too much. She voted in favor of a minor alteration to the Alternative Minimum Tax, to raise the exemption, while voting against a bill that would have repealed it, something that would have been a major tax reform. At the end of her term, she tried to raise the top marginal tax rate back to its pre-Bush level, which is hardly a \u201creform\u201d of the system.by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhile\u00a0one video\u00a0published by the Al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab in Somalia uses video of Trump calling for a\u00a0\u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d Trump is largely absent from Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Hamas, and Hezbollah propaganda \u2013 the major jihadist groups who expend resources on producing propaganda to recruit fighters.Much of the propaganda released by one of the most active jihadist groups in the world, the Islamic State, focuses largely on the Quranic theme of\u00a0jihad (\u201choly war\u201d) and cites both the Quran and the Islamic documents known as\u00a0hadiths. At one time,\u00a0half\u00a0of the propaganda the group published sold potential recruits on constructing a jihadist utopia in Syria and Iraq. Much of the\u00a0media\u00a0that does not touch on the benefits of living in a society cleansed of infidels instead depicts\u00a0graphic executions, including some\u00a0performed by children,\u00a0intended to intimidate the Western world.One exception is a video in which an image of Bill Clinton captioned \u201cfornicator\u201d is used as a rallying cry to destroy America, \u201ca secular state built on man-made laws whose soldiers fight for the interests of legislators, liars, fornicators, corporations, and for the freedom of Sodomites.\u201dThe rise\u00a0of\u00a0groups like the Islamic State \u2013 formerly Al Qaeda in Iraq \u2013 has been fueled significantly\u00a0by the growing chaos in the Middle East that followed the implementation of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy since 2008. The\u00a0Obama White House\u2019s approach\u00a0to the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, the fall of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, the Houthi uprising in Yemen, and the teenaged war in Afghanistan have all left significant power vacuums from which jihadist groups have benefitted greatly \u2013 not just the Islamic State, but formerly moribund jihadist groups like\u00a0Al Qaeda. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was\u00a0critical\u00a0in implementing these policies.by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: HALF FALSEIt is true that the Birther movement started among Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters. And, as Breitbart News reported, Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, admitted that at least one member of the campaign had helped propagate the rumor (though she said that person was fired.) It is also likely true that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal shopped the story to reporters. And it is unknown how much involvement Hillary Clinton herself had with the movement.However, it is a stretch to say, as Trump did, that Hillary Clinton herself personally started the Breitbart movement, and it is incorrect to claim that her campaign manager corroborated that particular accusation.(The real truth about the Birther rumor, which the mainstream media choose to ignore, may be that Barack Obama started it himself by allowing his literary agent to claim, for nearly two decades, that he was born in Kenya.)by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEThe\u00a0New York Times\u00a0obtained Trump\u2019s tax returns which revealed that the Republican nominee\u00a0avoided paying federal income taxes by reporting losses on his 1995 tax return.Clinton criticized Trump\u00a0as the hypocritical embodiment of\u00a0\u201cthe same rigged system he claims he will change.\u201dHowever, Clinton herself has taken advantage of the same tax loopholes she\u2019s hammered Trump over.\u00a0According to Clinton\u2019s\u00a02015 tax returns,\u00a0she reported capital gains losses to lessen her tax burden through a \u201ccarryover.\u201dOn page 17, \u201cCapital Gains and Losses\u201d for \u201cWilliam J Clinton\u00a0&\u00a0Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Clintons reported a \u201clong-term capital loss carryover\u201d of $699,540. In other words,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0reported a \u201cnet long-term capital gain or (loss)\u201d of negative \u201c$699,540.\u201dDuring Sunday\u2019s debate clinton also falsely stated that Trump is \u201csomebody who maybe hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in 20 years.\u201d\u00a0That statement is also false.\u00a0The\u00a0Times\u00a0admits that Trump\u2019s\u00a0tax statements reveal that he may have\u00a0avoided paying income taxes for \u201cup to 18 years.\u201cby Frances Martel9 Oct 2016\u201cThey had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,\u201d Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked.\u00a0\u201cYou were there as Secretary of State with the so-called \u2018line in the sand.'\u201d\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, I was gone,\u201d Clinton replied.Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEPresident Obama delivered his famous \u201cred line\u201d speech \u2013 in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a \u201cred line\u201d that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences \u2013\u00a0in August 2012.\u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,\u201d President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State\u00a0from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013,\u00a0according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad\u00a0used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation.\u00a0Assad was most recently accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in Aleppo in\u00a0September 2016. He remains dictator of Syria after \u201cwinning\u201d an election in 2014.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEClinton has frequently made this claim on the campaign trail, so media organizations have already had an opportunity to vet it. In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was \u201chidden\u201d and \u201cdebatable.\u201d\u201cBy all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children\u2019s health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,\u201d said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts \u2013 which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn\u2019t be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy\u2019s office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a legislator, she didn\u2019t write the law, and she wasn\u2019t the president, so she didn\u2019t make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\u201dThat encomium hardly supports Clinton\u2019s claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband\u2019s White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe \u2013 fact-checking Clinton\u2019s claims during her primary run against Barack Obama \u2013 found that Clinton \u201chad little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.\u201dOrrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, \u201cI do like her. We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No \u2013 Teddy does, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201d (\u201cTeddy\u201d is a reference to Senator Ted Kennedy.)by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSEClinton never apologized for the statement, despite what her running mate and other surrogates have claimed.\u00a0Here is her full statement\u00a0after her remarks emerged in the media. Note that the words \u201csorry\u201d and \u201capologize\u201d do not appear in any form, and that she merely says she \u201cregret[s]\u201d using the term \u201chalf.\u201d She doubled-down on the term \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\u00a0Even the Huffington Post, openly hostile to Trump, said: \u201cClinton Stands By \u2018Deplorables,\u2019 But Walks Back The Basket Size A Bit.\u201dHuffPo noted that Clinton said: \u201cI regret saying \u2018half\u2019 \u2015 that was wrong.\u201d But she did not apologize, and the reason she responded immediately was that she had been caught.by John Hayward9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSETrump made himself a victim of hyperbole with this statement. If he had said America was currently experiencing one of its slowest growth periods since 1929, he would have been entirely correct, but there have been a few slower periods \u2013 and, of course, a few outright recessions, or negative growth \u2013 since then.It would be playing word games to argue that the recessions shouldn\u2019t be counted, because they weren\u2019t economic growth. Even so, it wouldn\u2019t be correct to say the current growth rate is the absolute worst since 1929, although it is among the worst.It has been argued that the post-2009 recovery was the weakest of the post-war era, and that Obama\u2019s is the only presidency since the Great Depression that never reached 3% GDP growth, but that\u2019s not what Trump said.by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEDuring a\u00a0March 13,\u00a0CNN Town Hall\u00a0in Columbus, Ohio,\u00a0Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201dClinton\u00a0continued to explain\u00a0that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don\u2019t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.\u201dOhio, a key battleground state,\u00a0was the\u00a0ninth largest coal producing state\u00a0in 2013.\u00a0by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUEResponding to an audience question asking what he would do to diminish \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d Trump noted that the United States has been targeted on multiple occasions in the past year by \u201cradical Islamic terrorists. \u201cAnd she,\u201d referring to Clinton, \u201cwon\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t use the term, \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,'\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, to solve the problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name.\u201dIn their coverage of Sunday night\u2019s debate, website Politifact noted that \u201cTrump is right that Clinton and Obama prefer to avoid those words.\u201d While Clinton has, during the course of her campaign for president this year, claimed that she was comfortable saying \u201cradical Islamism\u201d (though not \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d) she has previously refused to use the term because\u00a0\u201cit sounds like we are declaring war against a religion.\u201dPresident Obama has refused to describe jihadist attacks as radical Islamic terrorism\u00a0because\u00a0\u201cterrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL \u2014 They have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse for basically barbarism and death.\u201dA recent Breitbart/Gravis poll\u00a0found that the issue of addressing jihadist attacks as \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d is of particular concerns of Americans of Hispanic descent. 67.7 percent of Hispanic American respondents \u2013 more than any other ethnic group, including White Americans \u2013 in the September 20 poll agreed with the phrase\u00a0\u201cWe must identify Islamic radical terrorism for what it is.

We have no growth in this country. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down to 1 percent. And that\u2019s like no growth. We\u2019re going lower in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\u201cShe,\u201d of course, refers to Hillary Clinton. Trump was speaking in the context of his own plan to lower taxes to spur economic growth, versus Clinton\u2019s plan to raise taxes.Trump said U.S. GDP growth is \u201cdown to 1 percent.\u201d In fact, GDP growth was originally reported as 1.1 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and later revised up to 1.4 percent. Trump\u2019s statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.As for Trump\u2019s assessment of the U.S. as having \u201cjust about the highest\u201d taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying \u201cjust about.\u201d More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he\u2019s talking about. There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates \u2013 America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world \u2013 currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico\u2019s unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.America\u2019s top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.Given the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America\u2019s were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that.by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: TRUE.According to\u00a0the\u00a0the Urban Institute, which examined the\u00a0average Obamacare premium increases from 2015 to 2016, American consumers can expect\u00a0to see major spikes in their healthcare costs.Those people in Oklahoma, who bought their own low-cost exchange insurance plan, have seen their premiums rise\u00a041.8 percent\u00a0from 2015 to 2016.

We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed. While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengageing [sic] the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.The Intercept reports that the memo discussed how to generate positive press for Clinton\u2019s decision making. The site found two articles by Haberman that did the job: here and here.In the first article, Haberman describes touts Clinton\u2019s decision to hire a research team to unearth\u00a0negative items about her \u2014 a process called \u201cself-vetting.\u201d Her insider account bore the title\u00a0\u201cHillary Clinton Begins Process of Vetting \u2014 Herself\u201d:The scope of the firm\u2019s work is unclear. But self-research is considered critical in campaigns. And in the six years since Mrs. Clinton was last a candidate, she has created a paper trail of paid speeches, charitable donations and diplomatic decisions as secretary of state.For months, Democrats not aligned with Mrs. Clinton had privately wondered whether she had started the process of assessing the scope of existing documents, information and other potential material her rivals could use against her. Some expressed concern that she was beginning this self-scrubbing process relatively late, and might not leave herself enough time to learn about her own potential vulnerabilities to be able to respond effectively.In the second article, \u201cHillary Clinton Aides Are in Talks to Fill Top Campaign Roles,\u201d Haberman shows the care and concern Clinton had building her team:The prospects are mostly people who have worked with Mrs. Clinton before, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who asked for anonymity to speak freely about personnel discussions.The conversations reflect a fast-moving effort by Mrs. Clinton to build a campaign as a number of Democratic Party operatives are vying for position. While the budding campaign had been criticized as too white and too male in its early stages, this group of operatives is diverse and would give Mrs. Clinton a number of women and people of color in top jobs.Greenwald and\u00a0Fang wrote that they gave both the Clinton campaign and Haberman 24 hours to contest the veracity of the documents.

I told the girls I can\u2019t take this. I\u2019m leaving. So I immediately left.\u201dBroaddrick said that \u201cwhat really went through my mind at that time is \u2018She knows. She knew. She\u2019s covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.\u2019\u201dThese details are consistent with a 2000 open letter that Broaddrick wrote during Clinton\u2019s campaign to become U.S. Senator for the state of New York.Goldberg dismisses Broaddrick\u2019s version of events, saying, \u201cBroaddrick interpreted this as a threat, but it sounds like the kind of thing a candidate\u2019s wife at a political event would say to all his supporters. Even in her rendering of Hillary\u2019s words, there is nothing outwardly sinister in them.\u201dGoldberg then declares the question of Hillary\u2019s intimidation asked and answered.\u00a0\u201cWhen you examine every accusation of Hillary as an \u2018attacker\u2019 of women, it ends up looking equally flimsy,\u201d she writes. Her evidence? The aforementioned anecdote from Broaddrick and a private note where Clinton called Monica Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic loony tune.\u201dUnmentioned by Goldberg:\u2022Kathleen Willey\u2019s allegation that she was harassed and intimidated before testifying during Paula Jones\u2019 sexual assault lawsuit against Bill.\n\u2022A San Francisco talk show host\u2019s claim that notorious private detective Jack Palladino copped to involvement in this alleged intimidation campaign (the Washington Post first reported that the Clintons hired Palladino to handle \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d in 1992).\n\u2022Vanity Fair reporting that Clinton said of Gennifer Flowers: \u201cI would crucify her\u201d in court \u2014 though she was telling the truth and Bill did admit, years later, to an affair with Flowers.Goldberg then concludes with\u00a0a wish for Hillary to perform well in Sunday night\u2019s presidential debate. \u201cBill Clinton\u2019s history with women is hard to defend,\u201d she\u00a0writes. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s history is not. And her own history is all she should be accountable for Sunday night.\u201dYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew,\u00a0or\u00a0email him at bkew@breitbart.com\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, gennifer flowers, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Michelle Goldberg, SlateComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

(AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton took nearly every precaution to ensure voters would never know what she told investment bankers, lobbyists and corporate executives in dozens of closed-door paid speeches before running for president.Turns out, the Democratic presidential nominee had good reason to do so.The private comments strike a tone starkly at odds with the fiery message she\u2019s pushed throughout her campaign, particularly during the hard-fought Democratic primary. Some of her remarks give fresh fuel to liberals\u2019 worst fears about Clinton, namely that she is a political moderate, happy to cut backroom deals with corporate interests and curry favor with Wall Street for campaign dollars.The WikiLeaks organization on Friday posted what it said were thousands of emails obtained in a hack of the Clinton campaign chairman\u2019s personal email account. Among the documents posted online was an internal review of the speeches conducted by campaign aides to survey the political damage her remarks could cause if they ever became public.In what aides calculated were the most damaging passages, she reflects on the necessity of \u201cunsavory\u201d political dealing, telling real estate investors that \u201cyou need both a public and private position.\u201d To investment bankers from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, Clinton admits that she\u2019s \u201ckind of far removed\u201d from the middle-class upbringing that she frequently touts on the campaign trail. She tells Xerox CEO Ursula Burns that both political parties should be \u201csensible, moderate, pragmatic.\u201dAnd in speeches to some of the country\u2019s biggest banks, she highlighted her long ties to Wall Street, bantering with top executives and saying that she views the financial industry as a partner in government regulation.\u201cPart of the problem with the political situation, too, is that there is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives,\u201d she said, according to an excerpt from an October 2013 discussion with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.Clinton appears to question the importance of the divestment of assets that financial executives often undertake to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest when they enter government service.\u201cYou know, the divestment of assets, the stripping of all kinds of positions, the sale of stocks. It just becomes very onerous and unnecessary,\u201d she said.Clinton\u2019s campaign has refused to confirm \u2014 or deny \u2014 the authenticity of the thousands of emails, suggesting they were part of a Russian effort to influence the outcome of the presidential race. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,\u201d campaign chairman John Podesta tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.\u201dIn an effort to keep those speeches private, strongly worded contracts prohibited unauthorized recordings, reporters were banned and, in some cases, blog posts about her remarks pulled off websites. Throughout her campaign, she has staunchly refused to release transcripts, resisting pressure from primary rival Bernie Sanders and the media to do so.The WikiLeaks disclosures should be the kind of \u201cOctober surprise\u201d that would thrill Clinton\u2019s opponents, who\u2019ve spent years attacking her as untrustworthy and willing to say anything for personal gain.Yet Republicans have found themselves largely unable to capitalize on the moment, consumed instead by the latest scandal of their nominee, a video showing Trump admitting to making predatory and lewd advances on women.This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has saved Clinton from damaging political fallout. The memory of Clinton staggering and stumbling after leaving a 9/11 memorial event last month was largely erased by Trump\u2019s destructive performance in the first presidential debate.But Clinton\u2019s private comments, now public, aren\u2019t going away. If she wins the White House, they\u2019ll trail her into the Oval Office, planting seeds of distrust among some of her liberal allies.A January 2016 email from the Clinton campaign\u2019s research director to top communications staffers includes excerpts from 15 of the more than 100 speeches she gave after leaving the State Department, appearances that netted her $21.7 million.One passage puts Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has struggled with repeatedly during the 2016 election. During the first general election debate, Clinton said she supports \u201csmart and fair trade.\u201dBut nearly three years earlier, in a talk to a Brazilian bank, she said her \u201cdream\u201d is \u201ca hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders\u201d and asked her audience to think of what doubling American trade with Latin America \u201cwould mean for everybody in this room.\u201dIn another speech that year, Clinton conceded that presidential candidates need the financial backing of Wall Street to mount a competitive national campaign. That\u2019s a position that plays right into political attacks leveled by both Sanders and Trump, who\u2019ve accused Clinton of being bought and paid for by Wall Street.\u201cNew York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle,\u201d she said at the October 2013 investor conference, sponsored by Goldman Sachs. \u201cThere are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy.\u201dThree years after her speech, her campaign and pro-Clinton super PACs have raised nearly $59 million from financial investors, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics.___Follow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Associated Press, Bernie Sanders, John Podesta, Lisa Lerer, Open Borders, wall street, WikiLeaksComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

McCabe9 Oct 2016Washington, D.C.0Raddatz, Breitbart News has learned, refused to publish a story on the alleged improper collusion and coordination between then Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) and the national headquarters of the\u00a0Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, also known as ACORN\u2014despite having enough evidence to do so.Raddatz, along with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, will co-moderate this upcoming Sunday evening\u2019s presidential debate between GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton.After she and her producer received a tip about ACORN corruption\u2014and Obama\u2019s connection to it\u2014and evidence backing up the eventual whistleblower\u2019s claims, they showed initial interest in pursuing the story. Anita Moncrief, the eventual ACORN whistleblower told Breitbart News exclusively that she met with Raddatz\u2019s producer Avni Patel in 2008.Both Patel and Raddatz were given documents that they covered up and refused to report on until after the election. Raddatz, who was then the White House correspondent for ABC News, and her producer Patel were also provided with personal accounts of the collusion between ACORN and the Obama campaign in October 2008, Moncrief told Breitbart News.Moncrief, who worked in ACORN\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters, would later expose the organization when she turned into a full-blown whistleblower after the election. But if Raddatz ran the story, the election may have turned out differently, especially had the public known the depths to which this scandal went.Moncrief told Breitbart News that she met with Raddatz\u2019s producer Patel in Washington after initially having made contact with Raddatz herself through a representative. The meeting lasted almost an hour in a coffee shop in Washington, D.C.After meeting with Patel, Moncrief received an email from the producer:Anita,\nIt was good talking to you today. I look forward to learning more, and\u00a0taking a look at those documents you mentioned. It sounds like the\u00a0easiest way to get those from you would be to directly download the\u00a0files from your web-transfer site. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can try\u00a0to\u00a0send them to my gmail account.Patel gave Moncrief every indication that ABC News was going to broadcast the report, she said.\u201cThey were very excited. They said they were willing to run the story,\u201d she said.Using the user name and password given to her by Patel, Moncrief sent documents on Oct. 14, 2008 to Patel using the company\u2019s file transfer protocol line, ftp1.abc.com.\u00a0There was another transfer of another dozen documents by email to Patel on Oct. 26, 2008.Moncrief told Breitbart News that ABC News received and acknowledged receipt of the documents that spelled out specific instances of collusion between the Obama campaign and named individuals at ACORN and Project Vote.\u00a0Among the documents were internal correspondences with Moncrief\u2019s name, which she said she included to prove that she was who she said she was.Moncrief told Breitbart News the Obama campaign passed to ACORN and by extension to its sister entity Project Vote the campaign\u2019s full donor list, which included all donors and fuller descriptions. This list was different from the limited list of contributors the campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission, which for example did not include small-dollar donors.\u00a0Because of their non-profit status, ACORN and Project Vote were prohibited from coordinating with a candidate\u2019s committee.ACORN and Project Vote also received the full donor lists from the 2004 presidential campaign of then Sen. John F. Kerry (D-MA), she said.Soon after Moncrief left ACORN, she contacted the New York Times and its reporter Stephanie Strom about the cooperation she witnessed. Strom and Moncrief worked together from July 2008 to October 2008.But, by September, Moncrief said she was frustrated with Strom\u2019s articles that were based on her information about ACORN and Project Vote, but failed to describe the cooperation.\u00a0Moncrief said Strom told her that her editors were watering down the stories after they were submitted.Attorney and columnist Michael Gaynor\u00a0told Breitbart News that over the summer of 2008, he became an adviser to Moncrief and her effort to expose ACORN-Obama corruption.In September 2008, Moncrief told him that she was beginning to think that the Times was just stringing her along, he said. \u201c\u2018I need a Plan B\u2019 she told me.\u201dGaynor calls himself a conservative Catholic and he said he immediately suggested EWTV, radio host Laura Ingraham and Fox News.The problem was that Moncrief was a left-wing activist and she wanted to go through a left-leaning media outlet, so he suggested ABC News and Martha Raddatz, he said.Gaynor said he met Raddatz through email because he she sent him proof that he had repeated a false claim about her suppressing the number of soldiers in Iraq supporting Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) for president.With that awkwardness between them, Gaynor said he reached out to Raddatz and explained to her the whole story of collusion between ACORN and Project Vote and the Obama campaign. After the initial conversation, Raddatz told Gaynor that she was interested.\u00a0Moncrief said she then emailed Raddatz and attached her resume, so that Raddatz would appreciate her background. Raddatz emailed back and told her that Patel would would follow up.Raddatz has a troubled history of undisclosed associations with Democrats that arguably affect her ability to be impartial.She\u00a0was the moderator for the 2012 vice presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and now House Speaker\u2014then GOP vice presidential nominee\u2014Paul Ryan. But Raddatz did not disclose to viewers that Biden\u2019s running mate, President Barack Obama, attended her 1991 wedding\u2014when she married now former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Julius Genachowski.The position of FCC chairman is a presidentially-appointed slot, which means Obama,\u00a0after attending her wedding to Genachowski,\u00a0appointed her by-then ex-husband to one of the most senior positions in the federal government. Raddatz and Genachowski divorced in 1997.\u00a0Genachowski, a long-time friend of the president\u2019s, also attended Obama\u2019s 1992 wedding,\u00a0when he married First Lady Michelle Obama.At a public event in 2013, after Obama and Biden won reelection, Breitbart News confronted Raddatz about her failure to disclose the significant conflict of interest to the general public before moderating that debate.At the National Press Club event, Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle asked Raddatz:\u201cDo you think\u2014there was obviously a little bit of a kerfuffle ahead of the vice presidential debate about the fact that the president attended your wedding to the FCC chairman. Do you think that that was handled right and given a second chance would you have done it a little differently?\u201dRaddatz responded:\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. I mean, I didn\u2019t have to handle that. It was\u2014and I\u2019m really not going to comment about that. That was something that happened two days before the debate. It had been in The New York Times quite a while before that, I believe. I just got to put this out of my head. That had nothing to do with what I did at the debate. Nothing.\u201dThis revelation about ABC News covering up the ACORN story before the 2008 election is also not the first time that network\u2014which is influenced heavily by former Bill Clinton White House staffer and ABC This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2014covered up a damning story about a Democrat right before an election.In fact, right before the 2012 election, ABC News among other outlets had been provided with intricate details about the scandal that has since, years later, led to the indictment of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ). They had a chance to break part of the scandal, and chose to not print allegations from prostitutes in the Dominican Republic that Menendez had underpaid them for sex.They also had evidence of other parts of the Menendez scandal, particularly connections to Democratic Party mega-donor Dr. Salomon Melgen\u2014who\u2019s also been indicted on the corruption charges\u2014that the network decided against running.When Raddatz had Menendez on her program after the election with the scandal dominating national news,\u00a0she conveniently forgot to ask him about it, as Breitbart News reported at the time.Shortly thereafter, ABC News attempted to undermine the accounts of several of the prostitutes\u2014but after Menendez was indicted, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed the prostitution allegations against Menendez were in fact supported by \u201ccorroborating evidence.\u201dEven BuzzFeed News admitted\u00a0Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle\u2014who originally reported the prostitution story while at The Daily Caller\u2014was correct on the story.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Acorn, barack obama, Bob Menendez, debate, Donald Trump, FCC, martha raddatzComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak9 Oct 20160The Democratic presidential nominee is exploiting\u00a0a video from 2005 that surfaced Friday, showing her Republican rival, Donald Trump, joking about groping women.Trump, while apologizing, has pointed to Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior towards women in the Oval Office and throughout his career \u2014 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in enabling it.Though Trump is not running against Bill, his defenders have focused on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s treatment of\u00a0the many women who accused her husband of impropriety and even assault \u2014 including Monica Lewinsky, Juanita Broaddrick, and others.The\u00a0Washington Post recently recalled the pattern of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defenses of her husband against what she called \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d:\u2026 Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers \u201csome failed cabaret singer who doesn\u2019t even have much of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to fall back on.\u201d She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, \u201cI mean, I would crucify her.\u201dThe\u00a0Post\u00a0noted: \u201cSix years later, Bill Clinton acknowledged a sexual encounter with Flowers.\u201dIt added that when the Lewinsky scandal emerged, in which Clinton had oral sex with the then-White House intern in the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton refused to credit the story of his accuser, choosing to believe her husband\u2019s lies instead. She reportedly called Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic loony toon.\u201dFormer Bill Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos, now an anchor for ABC News, wrote in his memoir All Too Human: A Political Education\u00a0that Hillary Clinton had to \u201csavage her enemies\u201d during the Lewinsky affair, repeating a pattern from previous scandals involving her husband\u2019s behavior towards women.In 1991, for example, when a woman named Connie Hamzy emerged to accuse Bill Clinton of having an affair with her, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cWe have to destroy her story,\u201d according to Stephanopoulos. He then set about arranging affidavits from people who could back up Bill Clinton\u2019s story: \u201cWe\u2019d survived our first bimbo eruption,\u201d Stephanopoulos recalled.Later, Stephanopoulos wrote, he wondered whether he had been \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior \u201cbecause my defense of Clinton against past bimbo eruptions had been predicated on my belief that he wouldn\u2019t create new ones.\u201dThe same might be said of Hillary Clinton.Joel B.

Some 47,000 Americans died from overdoses, mostly from heroin and other opiates, in just a single year, 2014.\u201cThe open border policies of Hillary Clinton, including catch and release, another terrible practice, have allowed a massive influx of drugs into New Hampshire, and frankly, to states all over our country. Almost every state. And it\u2019s really fueled the tremendous drug and heroin crisis that we have,\u201d Trump said.We\u2019re going to close up those borders, folks. Believe me. And I promise that to you in New Hampshire, more than anything else\u2014I said, I talk about it no matter where I go and I mention this state, because it was really the first glimpse I got at how serious a problem we have. They\u2019re poisoning our youth. They\u2019re poisoning more than our youth\u2014they\u2019re poisoning everybody. But they\u2019re poisoning our youth. It\u2019s tough enough out there. Our youth doesn\u2019t have a chance with what\u2019s happening, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore.\u201cWe\u2019re going to help the people that are so badly addicted,\u201d he added to applause. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help them\u2026 I\u2019m going to stop the drugs from coming in.\u201dNearly all of the heroin consumed in the U.S. comes from Mexico and is brought across the border by Mexican traffickers, the Washington Post reported before Trump\u2019s presidential run.While answering a question during the town hall, Trump repeated that he would stop the flow of deadly drugs pouring into the country. He said he had asked border patrol and ICE agents, \u201cHow important is the wall?\u201d\u201cThey said, \u2018Mr. Trump, it is absolutely necessary for us to do our proper job,'\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhich gave me a little additional security as far as the wall is concerned.\u201d\u201cWe need the wall. We have to stop the drugs\u2014heroin\u2014but many drugs. We have to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Believe me, it is poisoning our country. It\u2019s poisoning our youth. And we\u2019re going to stop it, and stop it fast, long before the wall gets up,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start that wall fast. I get \u2019em built fast. But I\u2019ll tell you, long before, we\u2019re going to stop that poison from flowing into our country.\u201d The audience applauded.While media outlets shut down their comments section so readers can\u2019t talk back, they can still receive massive blowback on Twitter.

Williams, Ph.D.7 Oct 20160In his article titled \u201cPope Francis\u2019 LGBT failure,\u201d Salon writer Nico Lang compares the Pope\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d against the gender ideology to those of \u201cthe right-wing extremists who have sought to prevent trans people from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity.\u201dThe Cool Pope is \u201cnot so cool after all,\u201d Lang quipped, just before comparing the Catholic Church to the Republican Party\u2014apparently the meanest slur he could come up with.The gender ideology claims that governments should require individuals to accept the \u201cgender identity\u201d of men or women who seek to live as members of the opposite sex. For example, new federal rules now urge punishment for K-12 students who refuse to use the female pronoun \u2013\u2018her\u201d \u2014 when referring a male classmate who dresses like a girl, or who do not want to share a bathroom with members of the opposite sex.Lang notes that this past weekend, Francis referred to teaching gender theory in schools as \u201cideological colonization.\u201dDuring his short\u00a0trip to the Caucasus, Pope Francis also called gender theory a \u201cgreat enemy\u201d of marriage, adding that the ideology of gender is part of a global war of ideas out to destroy traditional marriage.In an extended, off-the-cuff speech in Georgia, Francis said that today we are witnessing a \u201cglobal war to destroy marriage\u201d in which\u00a0gender theory\u00a0places a key role, fighting \u201cnot with weapons, but with ideas.\u201dBut although the Pope\u2019s stern opposition to gender theory may strike Nico Lang as a novelty, in point of fact, it is nothing new.For years the Pope has been an outspoken critic of LGBT agitators\u2019 efforts to impose same-sex marriage on society along with theories of gender fluidity that divorce gender from biological sexual differences.In March, Francis published an extensive\u00a0teaching\u00a0letter\u00a0on marriage and the family called\u00a0The Joy of Love\u00a0(Amoris Laetitia), in which he underscored the unique roles of motherhood and fatherhood, and called same-sex marriage legislation the \u201clegal deconstruction of the family.\u201dIn that same text, Francis slammed gender theory for its denial of \u201cthe difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman,\u201d and for its dream of \u201ca society without sexual differences.\u201d\u201cAn appreciation of our body as male or female,\u201d he said, is \u201cnecessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves.\u201d Efforts to erase sexual differences based in biology are a symptom of a sick society that \u201cno longer knows how to deal with it,\u201d he wrote.In the past, Francis has used even stronger language to denounce gender theory. In early 2014, the Pope called modern gender ideology \u201cdemonic,\u201d and compared the teaching of gender theory to children with the educational policies of\u00a0Hitler.In his Salon article, Lang declares that the pope\u2019s message on transgender \u201cboils down the old canard that the Catholic Church has been using against gays and lesbians for decades: \u2018Love the sinner, hate the sin.\u2019\u201dThe Pope\u2019s ideas are \u201cbiblically inaccurate\u201d and outdated, Lang insists.If loving sinners and hating sin is a \u201ccanard,\u201d at least the Pope has Jesus on his side\u2014even if Salon is no longer a fan.Follow Thomas D.

Still, hiring at that level is enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. Economists have expected the pace to slow as the supply of unemployed workers declines.The hiring figures could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise the short-term interest rate it controls by December. After seven years of pinning that rate at a record low near zero to try to spur more borrowing and spending, the Fed raised its rate in December. It has not acted since.But the Fed signaled after its policy meeting last month that it would likely act in the coming months. The Fed will meet in November, just before the election, but analysts expect it to hold off until the campaign ends.Recent data suggest that the economy is picking up after a weak start to the year, though growth is unlikely to accelerate very much.Consumer spending was flat in August, the weakest showing in five months. And factories have struggled as businesses have put off investing in new machinery, computers and other equipment.Still, a recent private survey found that manufacturing expanded in September after shrinking in August. Orders for factory goods jumped, suggesting that output may rise further.Consumers also appear increasingly confident about the economy, which could stimulate a rebound in spending. Consumer confidence reached a nine-year high last month.Retailers are expecting robust spending for the holiday shopping season. The National Retail Federation projects that holiday spending will rise 3.6 percent this year from last year. That\u2019s better than last year\u2019s gain and slightly above the 3.4 percent average since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009.The economy expanded at just a tepid 1.1 percent annual pace in the first six months of the year. Still, economists have forecast that growth accelerated to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annualized pace in the July-September quarter.The slower growth hasn\u2019t led employers to cut back on staffing. Applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, fell on average last month to a 43-year low.Big Government, Big Journalism, Economics, Federal Reserve, Jobs Numbers, unemploymentComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In fact the Playmates and and other Playboy employees described him as a good-humored professional, who responded to Playboy\u2018s invitations. Trump was a single man at the time.Of course, Trump\u2019s real crime is that he is the 2016 Republican nominee for president.Check out the salacious details CNN lays out:In that video \u2014 a 1994 VHS tape obtained by CNN titled \u201cPlayboy Centerfold\u201d \u2014 Trump takes part in Playboy magazine\u2019s search for its 40th anniversary Playmate.The scenes featuring Trump do not contain nudity or sexually explicit content, but other scenes in the movie depict fully nude women seductively rubbing themselves in different scenarios.In one scene, Trump interviews a potential model, asking her what qualities she possesses that would make her the right choice for the 40th anniversary cover.\u201cI believe that it\u2019s not just beauty, I think it\u2019s an attitude,\u201d the model says. \u201cI think it has a lot to do with personality and an attitude. I think Playboy really represents that, and I believe that I have that, and I have what it takes to represent them.\u201d\u201cWell I think you have what it takes too,\u201d Trump replies. \u201cAnd I think everyone in this room thinks you have what it takes also.\u201dAnything else, CNN?How about what else was going on a four-hour drive south in 1994?How about Paula Jones coming forward in 1994 to accuse Clinton of sexually propositioning her while she was an Arkansas state employee and he was governor.There were more scandals in those years of the Clinton administration, but none of them brought the nation to a halt like the the president\u2019s two-year affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.It was the relationship with Lewinsky that led to Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment and it was that relationship that forever stained the Oval Office, the president\u2019s study, the hallway between the Oval Office and the study and the restroom adjacent to the Oval Office.Seems a bigger deal that a few Polaroids.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Cable News Network, Donald J.

Hence the nastiness with which his books about the Clintons, including the latest, are greeted by the media: he is an apostate of journalism\u2019s left-wing political faith, and must be punished.The media that otherwise applauds the\u00a0fanciful behind-the-scenes drama in supposed tell-all books like Game Change, which ridiculed Sarah Palin and was turned into an HBO movie in time for the 2012 elections, dismisses\u00a0Klein\u2019s reporting on Hillary Clinton.But Klein\u2019s books about Hillary have featured exclusive interviews and news-breaking stories that other journalists have found hard to match. In\u00a0many cases, these interviews and stories have proven to be illuminating \u2014 and often prescient.In The Truth About Hillary (2005),\u00a0Klein was the first journalist to prove that Hillary knew about Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky long before it became public, and that when the story broke she tried to pretend she was shocked.\u00a0He also\u00a0documented the original source of Hillary\u2019s radical politics, the Reverend Don Jones, Hillary\u2019s youth minister, who gave Hillary a subscription to motive, a leftwing publication that favored Cuba, socialism, and the Black Panthers. She would go on to write her senior thesis at Wellesley about radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, corresponding with Alinsky himself.In\u00a0The Amateur (2012),\u00a0Klein unmasked Valerie Jarrett\u2019s shadow presidency and her infighting with Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. He also\u00a0revealed Obama\u2019s rift with\u00a0Oprah Winfrey, who declined\u00a0to campaign for Obama in 2012. The book came out in May; the New York Daily News reported on September 3 \u2014 nearly three months later \u2014 that Oprah would skip the Democratic National Convention. Later, in August, Klein\u00a0reported\u00a0that Obama offered the 2012 vice presidential spot to Clinton, a story that was confirmed a year later by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann\u00a0in their book Double Down.In\u00a0Blood Feud\u00a0(2014),\u00a0Klein was the first journalist to report on the jealousy and antipathy that divide the Obamas and the Clintons. The hatred between the Clintons and Obamas was substantiated two years later, on September 16, 2016, when Colin Powell\u2019s emails were leaked to the public. Klein also reported, correctly,\u00a0that Hillary knew from the beginning that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was carried out by an affiliate of al Qaeda. And he\u00a0was the first journalist to uncover the true story of Hillary\u2019s fainting spell and concussion while she was secretary of state, anticipating new doubts about her health.Nuzzi calls Klein\u2019s books \u201cnarrative fiction,\u201d which\u00a0better describes Hillary Clinton\u2019s stories about herself.\u00a0Clinton\u2019s more egregious biographical whoppers \u2014 the Tuzla dash, for example \u2014 are largely buried and forgotten, while the media spends months lending undue credibility to her\u00a0lies about a YouTube video in Benghazi, or about never sending classified material on her private email server, before finally admitting the truth and then promptly ignoring it, once she is past the worst danger.Klein relies heavily on unnamed sources, and dialogue that is reconstructed second- or even third-hand. That is fair game for criticism, as is his writing style, which tends toward the dramatic. And every journalist is bound to make a mistake or two.But many journalists, including Halperin and Heinemann of\u00a0Game Change renown,\u00a0use information from anonymous sources to tell important stories that otherwise would go unreported.\u00a0Why are their stories about Sarah Palin widely believed, while Klein\u2019s stories about Hillary Clinton are treated as toxic until proven true?The answer is too obvious to require explanation.Joel B.

And in fact, I think Trump saved my life, because looking at that field of candidates, I mean, I was hoping that Mitt Romney was going to get in. He was the best on immigration and, you know, a respectable person. He was good on China and their currency manipulation, and he was the best that we have ever had until Trump. But without him in the race, I just thought, \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t defend any of these guys. I am not going to go on TV and pretend that any of them are going to be better than any Democrat.\u201d And you know, I have always wanted to learn French, so I figured that I would just go to France for 2016 and skip the election year, hang out, learn French. And I happen to love Eagles of Death Metal, so I totally would have been at that concert, except Trump ran so I couldn\u2019t leave.Romney has come out against Trump. How does that fit for you?Well, the strange thing is that they are not different on policy. As I point out in my book, the American people are voting on the issues, while these alleged intellectuals and our party leaders say they are voting on substance. \u201cNo, we think that he is tacky. We can\u2019t support him.\u201d But you know, Mr. Romney, this is what you said about China. You are the one with the self-deportation. You are the one who wanted to protect American jobs.

(Since dropped by the media in order to help Hillary avoid the subject.)(4) He is corrupt.(5) He is a bad businessman.(6) He is not a Republican. (Also since dropped \u2014 Hillary\u2019s losing enough Democrats to Trump without reminding them that he\u2019s not a \u201creal Republican.\u201d)(7) His \u201ctone.\u201dAll that\u2019s already been priced into the Trump brand. What new results do the media expect from telling us that Trump not only insulted Rosie O\u2019Donnell, but also insulted Hispanic Mattress Girl, Alicia Machado: baby mama to a Mexican drug lord?The only advance in the narrative is that the octaves of journalists\u2019 voices keep getting higher, as they repeat the exact same attacks on Trump.Each time, the media claim victory by asserting with bland certainty that any drop in Trump\u2019s poll numbers is because of something very upsetting to journalists, but which is generally quite popular with voters \u2014 the Mexican rapists speech, the Muslim ban, and his response to the choleric Muslim, Khizr Khan.The media can tell us where the candidates stand in the polls. They can\u2019t tell us why. Nonetheless, they insist on identifying the precise statement of Trump\u2019s that has caused any setback, which always happens to be whatever the media is being hysterical about.Most absurd was the widely repeated claim that Trump\u2019s \u201cinsult\u201d of GOLD STAR DAD Khizr Khan caused him to dip in the polls. Except the problem is: (1) He didn\u2019t insult Khan; and (2) anyone who occasionally leaves his apartment realizes that no one would have minded if he had.Khan\u2019s son was one of 14 Muslims to die serving in the U.S. military, which, coincidentally, is the precise number of American soldiers who have been killed\u00a0by\u00a0Muslims serving in the U.S. Military.At the Democratic Convention, Khan waved a copy of the Constitution, asking Trump, \u201cHave you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words, \u2018the right of all Muslims in the world to move to America shall not be abridged!\u2019\u201dActually, that\u2019s not in the Constitution. Incomprehensibly, Khan told Trump to look for the words \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cequal protection of law\u201d \u2014 words that are noticeable for not mentioning \u201cthe right of all Muslims in the world to move to America.\u201dHe rounded out his harangue saying to Trump: \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing and no one!\u201dIn an article titled \u201cIre for Trump as He Derides Muslim Parents,\u201d The New York Times described Trump\u2019s response to Khan as \u201cstartling,\u201d and said it \u201cdrew quick and widespread condemnation.\u201d This included a tweet from Bush speechwriter Peter Wehner, calling Trump \u201ca man of sadistic cruelty. With him there\u2019s no bottom. Now go ahead and defend him.\u201dI must have accidentally been out of the country for a few days because I missed the part where Trump insulted the Khans.But according to the Times, Trump was \u201cderid(ing)\u201d the Khans when he went on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and called the snarling Muslim a \u201cnice guy,\u201d wished him luck, wondered why his wife didn\u2019t say anything, and talked about the reasons Americans might want to hit the pause button on mass Muslim immigration.To wit, Trump said:\u201cWell, I would say, we have had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism, that\u2019s what I\u2019d say. We have had a lot of problems where you look at San Bernardino, you look at Orlando, you look at the World Trade Center, you look at so many different things. You look at what happened to the priest over the weekend in Paris, where his throat was cut, 85-year-old, beloved Catholic priest. You look at what happened in Nice, France, a couple of weeks ago. I would say, you gotta take a look at that, because something is going on, and it\u2019s not good.\u201dI understand why the media are upset that Trump mentioned these notable contributions of Muslim immigrants, but unless I don\u2019t know the country at all anymore, I do not believe a majority of Americans minded one bit.The media are betting that after 9/11, the diaper bomber, the shoe bomber, the Boston Marathon, Fort Hood, Chattanooga, San Bernardino, the Orlando nightclub, the Chelsea bombing, and the recent mall attacks in both Minnesota and Washington, the revulsion of the American public to anti-Muslim bigotry will be a HUGE factor in this election.Journalists swim in a sea of agreement. They don\u2019t stop to think that the identity politics they majored in back in college might not be popular with all Americans.Polls showed a post-convention bounce for Hillary before Trump had said word one about Khan. Perhaps their nonsense headlines about Trump attacking a GOLD STAR FAMILY also helped them in the short run.But as soon as the public found out that it was this specific family and, also, that Trump didn\u2019t attack them, voters weren\u2019t mad at Trump, but they sure were with the media.COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER\u00a0\nDISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Alicia Machado, Ann Coulter, Donald Trump, Khizr KhanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Times, L.A Mag, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, The Daily Mirror\u00a0The Huffington Post, Mic.com, BuzzFeed, Deadspin, Business Insider, The Verge, TechCrunch, The Daily Dot, Gadgette, and Tech Insider.Broadcast journalists were also present on the list, which included reporters, directors, and managers from MSNBC, CNBC, BBC, CNN, and ESPN.One employee of the Associated Press, a strategy manager, was also present on the list.Breitbart\u00a0contacted all journalists on the email chain, including Peck, to confirm the authenticity of the email and to gauge their opinion on the ethics of attempts to coordinate coverage across multiple journalistic outlets.Most journalists on the email chain did not reply to our request for comment, but there were a few exceptions. When asked to confirm the authenticity of the email,\u00a0Colin Pinkham, a contributor to Jezebel, Wonkette, Uproxx and Fusion told us this:I can confirm that id rather shove a red hot cactus up my ass than ever say anything that might in any way benefit the douchehats at Breitbart.Dell Cameron, a reporter for the Daily Dot, got back to us with a similar, though less graphic reply.I can confirm that\u00a01.609 is a good number to multiply mileage by if you\u2019re trying to figure out approximately how many kilometers you\u2019ve driven.Miles Klee, an editor at the Daily Dot, was more detailed in his flippancy.That email did indeed come from Jamie Peck, and everyone on the resulting thread\u2014several hundred editors and writers in all\u2014agreed not to cover the art show in question. Furthermore, some of us have decided to go to the art show anyway (in secret, of course) and fart on the art. I am one of these volunteers, but my conscience is beginning to gnaw at me. Is this ethical? Will it even accomplish anything? I am adrift and looking for any answers. Thank you for exposing this nefarious plot, and godspeed.Eventually, serious replies began to trickle in. One journalist, who wanted his name and publication kept off the record, confirmed that the he \u201cdid get the email\u201d and that \u201cit comes from an email address I believe to be Peck.\u201dAnother journalist, from a mainstream web publication, confirmed that they also received the email, although they were slightly baffled as to why. \u201cYeah it\u2019s real.\u00a0We all received it. I don\u2019t know why the fuck I\u2019m on that thread and I don\u2019t why the fuck people keep emailing it. But I did. It\u2019s real.\u201dTed\u00a0Scheinman, an editor for the\u00a0Pacific Standard,\u00a0also confirmed that he believed the email to be from Peck, although he argued that because the email chain emerged out of happenstance, there was nothing nefarious about it or Peck\u2019s use of it.Oh yes, I assumed the email was legitimate, though I myself don\u2019t know Jamie Peck \u2013 \u2013 one of the many odd things about this list is that it includes a seemingly random group of web and magazine writers, many (or most?) of whom didn\u2019t know each other before the original email, and who also (I think) work on vastly different beats from one another. Some aren\u2019t journalists at all.\u201dI didn\u2019t in the least read Peck\u2019s email as pressuring collusion, still less as the start of some dark coordinated effort. Remember that this isn\u2019t a curated list of likeminded journalists; it\u2019s an assortment of people brought together purely because one of these guys (Shkreli) spammed us a handful of times in a bid for press and general attention. (I suspect he would say it was merely to ruin our day, or something.)So the list began as this weird random web thing and continued in that vein \u2013 \u2013 hardly a secret group of journalist co-conspirators. Christ, there\u2019s at least one sex worker on the email list; she wrote in and made it clear that she had no desire to be counted among journalists. I liked that response a lot.According to our information, no journalist on the list has responded to Peck\u2019s request with support or disavowal, which makes it difficult to tell who among them are following her lead on the\u00a0proposed blackout. Judging by the responses of the Daily Dot and Jezebel contributors however, there\u2019s no shortage of anti-conservative sentiment among the journalists on the list.What we do know is that no publication named on the list has covered Wintrich\u2019s upcoming event, which is politically newsworthy and features a number of high-profile figures from media and business.A comprehensive list of the publications contacted by Peck is copied below. We will not reveal the names or email addresses of the individual journalists contacted at this time.At the time of writing, none of the contacted publications have covered Wintrich\u2019s art show.Disclosure: This author has previouly contributed an article to TechCrunch, which is one of the publications named in this\u00a0list.Correction: Mic.com did cover a story related to Lucian Wintrich\u2019s art exhibition, about a planned fundraiser for LGBT veterans.\u00a0You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.\u00a0Email tips and suggestions to abokhari@breitbart.com.Big Journalism, Milo, Tech, Alt Right, Death And Taxes, Jamie Peck, Lucian Wintrich, Martin Shkreli, Milo YiannopoulosComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak4 Oct 20160Much of the criticism for Kaine involved his repeated interruptions of his Republican rival, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. (The Republican National Committee counted 57 interruptions.)But Conway, speaking to Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly in the spin room after the debate, highlighted Kaine\u2019s interruptions of CBS News\u2019 Elaine Quijano.Kelly was skeptical, but Conway defended her point, noting that she was just holding Kaine to the Clinton\u00a0campaign\u2019s own standard:Conway: There he was, interrupting a female moderator. We lost track of the times. We\u00a0just stopped writing it down. He was interrupting \u2014Kelly: You can interrupt a female moderator, same as a male.Conway: Well, no. It\u2019s the Clinton campaign who loves to throw around words like \u201csexism\u201d and \u201cunhinged.\u201d They\u2019ve got to be regretting those words on a night like tonight, when Tim Kaine looked like both.Later in the interview, Kelly asked Conway about Trump\u2019s low approval ratings with women in some polls. Conway reiterated her\u00a0view that Kaine had damaged himself, and the Clinton campaign: \u201cYou think that Tim Kaine\u2019s performance tonight is going to\u00a0sit well with women?\u201dShe added: \u201cI think you\u2019re going to hear from all the pundits tonight, \u201cthese vice-presidential debates don\u2019t really matter, they won\u2019t move the polls,\u2019 because they know how lopsided a victory it was for Mike Pence.\u201dUpdate: Later, Conway reiterated the point in an interview with Sean Hannity, noting that if Donald Trump or Mike Pence had treated a female moderator the way Tim Kaine had, it would have been a scandal.Joel B.

Pollak4 Oct 20160Those doubts are twofold: first, about her decision to choose\u00a0so weak a candidate, who seemed unable to answer basic policy questions; and second, about Clinton\u2019s\u00a0health, since if her medical troubles are as bad as feared, Kaine may be taking over\u00a0at some point if she is elected.Kaine could not stop interrupting Pence, at times sounding high-pitched and shrill, at times whining and\u00a0defensive. Pence was cool and even-tempered \u2014 presidential, in other words, while Kaine seemed to be playing\u00a0cable news pundit.The Democrat was often\u00a0unable to suppress the juvenile impulse to shout campaign talking points, even in the middle of his opponent\u2019s answers. At one point, he interjected: \u201cOur plan is like Ronald Reagan\u2019s plan from 1986.\u201d (Note to Democrats: the Reagan plan failed.)Later, when the moderator asked why Putin would respect a Trump-Pence administration, Pence answered: \u201cStrength.\u201d Kaine, unable to restrain himself, blurted out: \u201cBusiness deals.\u201d His smirk\u00a0betrayed his conviction that he had just scored points, even though the moderator had to instruct him \u2014 for the third time, at least \u2014 to wait until it was his turn to speak.Kaine seemed not to understand how un-serious\u00a0he looked. Pence responded with a steady, and appropriate, put-down: \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense.\u201dPence also beat Kaine over the head with the Russian \u201creset,\u201d Clinton\u2019s email scandal, and the Clinton Foundation.

Pollak4 Oct 20160Columnist Charles M. Blow led\u00a0with that inflammatory accusation on Monday\u2019s opinion page:Donald Trump is a domestic terrorist; only his form of terror doesn\u2019t boil down to blowing things up. He\u2019s the 70-year-old toddler who knows nearly nothing, hurls insults, has simplistic solutions for complex problems and is quick to throw a tantrum. Also, in case you didn\u2019t know it, this toddler is mean to girls and is a bit of a bigot.Blow did not define what he meant by \u201cterrorist.\u201dThe episode recalls one in 2011, when columnist Joe Nocera called the Tea Party movement \u201cterrorists\u201d:You know what they say: Never negotiate with terrorists. It only encourages them.These last few months, much of the country has watched in horror as the Tea Party Republicans have waged jihad on the American people. Their intransigent demands for deep spending cuts, coupled with their almost gleeful willingness to destroy one of America\u2019s most invaluable assets, its full faith and credit, were incredibly irresponsible. But they didn\u2019t care. Their goal, they believed, was worth blowing up the country for, if that\u2019s what it took.The\u00a0Times editorial page appears to be holding a name-calling competition. Tuesday\u2019s paper featured Roger Cohen opening in a similar style to Blow, albeit with a slightly less inflammatory epithet:Donald Trump is a thug. He\u2019s a thug who talks gibberish, and lies, and cheats, and has issues, to put it mildly, with women. He\u2019s lazy and limited and he has an attention span of a nanosecond.

Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: TRUE.Not only did foreign governments and foreign donors give to the Clinton\u2019s family charity, but the majority of people outside of the government who met with Clinton while she was in office were Clinton Foundation donors, according to the Associated Press.The ultimate proof of Pence\u2019s claim? The Clinton Foundation has grudgingly said that it would no longer accept foreign contributions if she became president.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In fact, former President Clinton\u2019s exact words on Monday were as follows:So you\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.CNN reports Clinton realized his mistake and tried to walk his comments back the following day:Look, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good, and the 50-something efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake. We, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90% of our people. But there is a group of people \u2014 mostly small business owners and employees \u2014 who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can\u2019t get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they\u2019re not in big pools, so they have no bargaining power.by Katie McHugh4 Oct 2016In his June 16, 2015 speech announcing his run for the presidency, Donald Trump said the following: When do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they\u2019re killing us economically.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems.Thank you. It\u2019s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we\u2019re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They\u2019re sending us not the right people.It\u2019s coming from more than Mexico. It\u2019s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it\u2019s coming probably\u2014 probably\u2014 from the Middle East. But we don\u2019t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s got to stop and it\u2019s got to stop fast.Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U.S.-Mexico border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. As Breitbart Texas has extensively documented, it\u2019s common for human traffickers to \u201cto sexually assault or rape the females\u201d en route to the U.S., and the smugglers \u201cusually remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree\u2014a rape tree.\u201d Furthermore, it is true that as the U.S. suffers from a massive heroin epidemic that killed over 47,000 people in 2014 alone, \u201cnearly all\u201d of the heroin consumed in the U.S. is smuggled in by Mexican traffickers, as the Washington Post found. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent operation. \u00a0UPDATE: Later in\u00a0Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate, while trying to attack Trump\u2019s detailed immigration policy proposals, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine again claimed that Donald Trump and Mike Pence said \u201call Mexicans are bad.\u201d\u00a0Fact Check: FALSE. These words have never been uttered by either the Republican presidential nominee or vice presidential nominee. Again, Trump specifically criticized the rampant criminal activities committed by illegal aliens coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, many of whom are Mexican nationals.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.The stop-and-frisk policy dates back to a 1968 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed police to stop and frisk in individual based on a reasonable suspicion that he or she is armed and dangerous and may be involved in a crime. The policy has been constitutional for nearly four decades. During that time, and especially during the last two decades (until the last two years), relationships between police and communities have improved.\u00a0After Bill de Blasio became mayor of New York in 2014, that city dropped stop-and-frisk. That coincided with a precipitous decline in the relationship between police and communities. If stop-and-frisk were the cause of the friction, ending that policy would have resulted in better and more harmonious relationships. Stop-and-frisk has nothing to do with the present controversy.by Frances Martel4 Oct 2016\u201cDid you know Iran\u00a0was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?\u201d Kaine asked, adding later, \u201cUnder Secretary Clinton\u2019s leadership\u2026 [the United States] worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.\u201dThere is no evidence that the Islamic Republic of Iran has abandoned its nuclear ambitions, and subsequent revelations of secret \u201cside deals\u201d as part of the greater JCPoA exposed the fact that Iran may be able to double its uranium enrichment capacity after a decade.The Iranian nuclear deal was\u00a0signed in July\u00a02015. A year later, the Associated Press\u00a0published the provisions\u00a0hidden in a document not publicly available previously, which elucidated what would happen to the Iranian nuclear program\u00a0after the first ten years of the agreement\u2019s implementation. According to that document, Iran will be allowed to begin \u201creplacing its mainstay centrifuges with thousands of advanced machines.\u201d While it will ultimately possess fewer centrifuges to enrich uranium with, these machines will be so efficient, the AP notes, that \u201cthey will allow Iran to enrich at more than twice the rate it is doing now.\u201dA report\u00a0released this September by the\u00a0Institute for Science and International Security found that the deal will also allow, through an exemption, Iran to keep 50 tons of\u00a0heavy water\u00a0and \u201ccontinue operating 19 \u2018hot cell\u2019 radiation containment chambers.\u201dPossessing materials such as enriched uranium and heavy water does not necessarily mean Iran will have the capacity to restore its nuclear program. The deal will\u00a0not allow nuclear inspectors to confirm, however, whether or not Iran is complying with the deal. Iran got negotiators to agree that no U.S. nuclear inspectors will be allowed on Iranian soil.Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has done little to calm those alarmed by the possibility of Iran having access to advance uranium enrichment technology. Shortly after the signing of the deal, he published a book titled\u00a0Palestine, in which he argues that Iran has a role to play in the destruction of Israel, and so must work to create and possess the strongest weapons possible.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In May, Trump said he thought minimum wage levels should be left to the states, and offered the opinion that the current minimum wage sounds too low for workers to make a decent living. Later, in August, he expressed support for raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour, but still preferred to let state governments handle the issue.\u201cI have seen what\u2019s going on. And I don\u2019t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I\u2019d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don\u2019t forget, the states have to compete with each other,\u201d Trump said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on May 8, 2016.Asked by NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd if he thought the federal government should set a minimum wage floor, Trump replied:No, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re working. It is a very low number. You know, with what\u2019s happened to the economy, with what\u2019s happened to the cost. I mean, it\u2019s just\u2013 I don\u2019t know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.In August, Trump told Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News that he still does not believe there \u201chas to be\u201d a federal minimum wage, but added, \u201cI would leave it and raise it somewhat. You need to help people. I know it\u2019s not very Republican to say.\u201dWhen O\u2019Reilly proposed a $10 minimum wage, Trump replied, \u201cI would say 10. I would say 10. But with the understanding that somebody like me is going to bring back jobs. I don\u2019t want people to be in that $10 category for very long. But the thing is, Bill, let the states make the deal.\u201dTrump has maintained this position in several subsequent comments: he believes the minimum wage should be raised to $10, but the states should do it, not the federal government.by AWR Hawkins4 Oct 2016He used the example of the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech attack to make his point. During that attack a gunman walked into gun-free zones on the Virginia Tech campus, shooting and killing 32 innocents. What Kaine failed to mention is that the Virginia Tech gunman passed a background check for his firearm.\u00a0And the Virginia Tech gunman is not an anomaly among mass public attackers, Breitbart News previously reported that the vast majority of public attackers\u2013and alleged attackers\u2013of recent memory all acquired their guns via background checks. These include:In addition to these examples, Paris, France, has extremely comprehensive background checks\u2013even more comprehensive than those in California\u2013yet they also suffered 12 shot and killed during the January 7, 2015, Charlie Hebdo attack and lost another 130 innocents killed during a November 13, 2015, firearm-based terror attack in the city.The bottom line: Kaine\u2019s statement that background checks \u201cmake us safer\u201d is only true if you dismiss all the instances in which they haven\u2019t.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.Donald Trump has never made the U.S. alliance with Israel conditional. Period. That part of the statement \u2014 \u201cONLY work together with Israel if\u2026\u201d \u2014 is 100% false.As for the phrase \u201cbig league,\u201d Trump did use those words \u2014 but not specifically in relation to Israel. He was talking, in general, about countries that America defends.\u00a0Israel is not one of them: the U.S. provides money for Israeli defense, but does not defend Israel directly.\u00a0Here is Trump\u2019s exact quote, as reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency:At a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Monday, the Republican presidential front-runner was asked whether he believed the Israeli government should pay for American defense, as he had called for other U.S. allies, such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia, to do.\u201cI think Israel will do that also, yeah, I think Israel do \u2014 there are many countries that can pay and they can pay big league,\u201d Trump responded.\u201dLater that day, Trump gave a well-received speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) annual policy conference.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In fact, as CNN Money noted in a July profile of Pence, he was a \u201cleading fiscal conservative\u201d during his 12 years in Congress, and \u201cbacked various efforts to reform Social Security in a bid to make the program solvent for the long term and to reduce government spending.\u201d As CNN Money noted, one of those reform plans was proposed by President George W. Bush. Pence and other conservatives had \u201cpreviously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush\u2019s \u2013 one that would have phased in faster and let workers put more of their payroll taxes into private accounts.\u201dIt is a common liberal caricature of these proposals to claim they would have wiped out Social Security, but this is merely hysterical rhetoric, of the sort deployed against all serious reform efforts. Allowing workers the option to put some of their money into private accounts would not have \u201crepealed\u201d or \u201cdestroyed\u201d Social Security; those who proposed such reforms were explicitly attempting to save the system, which is unquestionably heading for insolvency, according to the Social Security trustees themselves.CNN Money also recalled Pence stating that cuts to Social Security payments, or increases to the retirement age, were \u201con the table\u201d in 2010. \u201cI think everything has to be on the table. I\u2019m an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu,\u201d Pence declared.Most politicians, including most Democrats, make similar statements about looking at all options to keep Social Security solvent for as long as possible. President Barack Obama proposed cuts to Social Security benefits in his budget for fiscal 2015, for example. Raising the retirement age is frequently discussed as a way to keep the system running as the U.S. population ages, although the idea is always controversial. As for Donald Trump, he has said, \u201cI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cas our demography changes, a prudent administration would begin to examine what changes might be necessary for future generations.\u201dby Frances Martel4 Oct 2016\u201cThe terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because\u00a0Bin Laden is dead,\u201d Kaine argued, receiving the question to answer before rival Mike Pence. \u201cThe terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because the Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped,\u201d he added, arguing that U.S. troops are also safer because there are \u201cnot 175,000 in a dangerous part in the world, there\u2019s only 15,000.\u201dThe death of Al Qaeda head Osama bin Laden with little strategy\u00a0for what to do with the beheaded jihadi organization has led to the terror group splintering into multiple factions. Al Qaeda in Iraq, once led by former terror camp leader\u00a0Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, evolved into what is now known as the Islamic State, led by self-appointed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Al Qaeda affiliated militia\u00a0al-Nusra Front\u00a0has officially severed from its parent terrorist group in Syria, and continues operating as a jihadist terror group under the name \u201cJabhat Fateh al-Sham.\u201dDespite parenting new, deadly terror threats, Al Qaeda itself remains\u00a0extremely formidable, expanding out of terrorist attacks and into \u201cdrug trafficking\u00a0affiliated with Mexican drug cartels, kidnapping for ransom, smuggling of arms, wildlife, coal, oil, gas, timber, precious metals, and people.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThis has enabled them not only to become independent but also richer and more powerful,\u201d according to a\u00a0Global Terrorism Index (GTI)\u00a0report.Al Qaeda has also cemented itself in regions destabilized during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, notably\u00a0Libya\u00a0and\u00a0Yemen.Kaine\u2019s claim that the Iranian nuclear deal (the \u201cJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u201d \u2013 JCPoA) eliminates the Iranian nuclear program entirely has been\u00a0proven inaccurate.The Chairman of the 9/11 Commission has said that the threat of terrorism worldwide is\u00a0greater in 2016 than in 2001. For a numerical analysis,\u00a0the Global Terrorism Index (GTI)\u00a0documented\u00a032,685 terrorist-caused deaths in 2014, compared to slightly over 5,000 in 2001.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In truth, Pence said Putin was a \u201cstronger leader\u201d than Obama, which is very different from Kaine\u2019s characterization of his remarks.\u201cI think it\u2019s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that\u2019s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president,\u201d Pence said during an interview with Dana Bash of CNN, responding to a question about Donald Trump making a similar comment the previous evening at the Commander-in-Chief forum. Pence also noted Trump \u201csaid last night he doesn\u2019t particularly like the system\u201d in Russia. by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.Kaine used a repeated \u2014 and made-up \u2014 Obama administration talking point, citing supposed \u201cexperts\u201d inside Israeli intelligence who back the Iran deal.\u00a0In August, the Israeli government responded directly to Obama\u2019s claim \u2014 which Kaine, regrettably, repeated.As the Times of Israel reported:A top minister close to Netanyahu, meanwhile, directly contradicted Obama\u2019s assertion that Israeli security officials now back the accord. \u201cI don\u2019t know to which Israelis he (Obama) spoke recently. But I can promise you that the position of the prime minister, the defense minister and of most senior officials in the defense establishment has not changed,\u201d Tzachi Hanegbi told The Times of Israel.\u201cThe opposite is the case. The time that has elapsed since the deal was signed proved all our worries that, regrettably, we were justified before the deal was made,\u201d said Hanegbi, a minister who works in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and who until recently chaired the Knesset\u2019s powerful Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.\u00a0The Defense Ministry used more emotive language to contradict Obama.\u201cThe Israeli defense establishment believes that agreements have value only if they are based on the existing reality, but they have no value if the facts on the ground are the complete opposite of those the deal is based upon,\u201d the Ministry said in a statement.Later, Kaine repeated his claim, citing Gadi Eizenkot, one of Israel\u2019s military leaders. Eizenkot was cautiously optimistic about the deal when it went into effect, but did not say that it had stopped or eliminated Iran\u2019s nuclear program, nor even that it prevented an Iranian nuclear weapon. He said that the deal \u201chas many risks, but also presents many opportunities.\u201d That is far from Kaine\u2019s claim.by Joel B.

Charity Navigator is the much larger and more highly regarded site.\u201dIn addition, Charity Navigator had put the Clinton Foundation on a \u201cwatch list,\u201d partly due to concerns over donations from foreign governments during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State. It reinstated the Clinton Foundation, conveniently, in time for the 2016 presidential election.The integrity of the American Red Cross has never been in question. Not so, the Clinton Foundation.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016Kaine claimed to be proud of the boycott at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not dumb, I knew not going to the speech might make some folks mad with me \u2013 there would be a political price, but I felt so strongly as a matter of principle that this was done in an entirely inappropriate way,\u201d he told Forward, denouncing Netanyahu\u2019s speech as \u201cdone purely to try and influence the Israeli elections and demonstrate American support for one person and one party.\u201dKaine was particularly incensed by Netanyahu\u2019s criticism of the Iran nuclear deal \u2013 the same deal he now claims Israel supports.\u201cKaine worked behind the scenes to try to delay the speech, but when that failed, was among the first Democratic senators to announce that they would not attend the address,\u201d the Times of Israel reported in July.The New York Sun had little patience for Kaine\u2019s claims to have \u201cpaid a price\u201d for his stance: \u201cAs for the price Mr. Kaine has supposedly paid for his willingness to boycott Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s speech, he can now count his selection as his party\u2019s vice presidential nominee. What a cost.\u201dThe Sun declared that Clinton\u2019s choice of \u201cone of the eight Democrats who boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s address last year to a joint meeting of Congress\u201d as her running mate was \u201cone marker of the fact that for all Mrs. Clinton\u2019s protestations of support for the Jewish State, it would be a fool\u2019s wager to count on her when the chips are down.\u201dby Jerome Hudson4 Oct 2016What Senator Kaine failed to mention is that the governor of Virginia during Johns\u2019 walk-out was a Democrat named John Stewart Battle.Johns was\u00a0protesting Virginia\u2019s\u00a0segregated\u00a0public school systems.\u00a0It was in 1951 when a 16-year-old Johns walked out of her\u00a0Moton High School, an\u00a0all-black school in\u00a0Farmville, Virginia, which sat across the street from an all-white high school.\u00a0Battle, who was elected Virginia governor in 1950, was known widely as a\u00a0segregationist\u00a0\u2014 and he governed as such.\u00a0According to the\u00a0Encyclopedia of Virginia, \u201cwhen the\u00a0National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, demanded the desegregation of state parks, Battle raised the possibility of closing them instead.\u201dby Jerome Hudson4 Oct 2016This is absolutely false.Indeed, during Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy on Wednesday\u00a0August 31\u00a0in Phoenix, the\u00a0Republican presidential nominee promised the audience that on \u201cday one\u201d the \u201c2 million\u00a0riminal aliens now inside of our country\u201d are \u201cgone.\u201dTrump\u00a0said\u00a0his administration will have \u201czero tolerance for criminal aliens.\u201dThe portion of\u00a0Trump\u2019s immigration speech\u00a0where he talks about deporting illegal aliens can be found below:According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens.\u00a0We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: FALSE.That is not unconstitutional. That is current U.S. immigration policy. We prefer some countries over others. That is constitutional, lawful, and logical.There is no U.S. constitutional provision providing equal protection for people based on national origin \u2014 certainly when they are not yet in the United States!Kaine went further, saying that it was unconstitutional for Donald Trump to \u201ckeep them out if they\u2019re Muslim.\u201d Trump has since softened that stance somewhat, and now wants to keep people out from terror-prone countries. But regardless, the constitutional protection against religious discrimination does not apply to people who are not yet immigrants, residents or citizens.In fact, our current immigration policy \u201cdiscriminates\u201d against Muslims because it does not permit people to bring over their spouses from polygamous marriages, which are permitted in many Muslim countries. That kind of discrimination is constitutional and lawful.It would, arguably, be appropriate for the U.S. to discriminate in favor of some religions \u2014 such as Christians and Yazidis \u2014 who are subject to discrimination and persecution in the Muslim world.Regardless, it would be constitutional to do so.by Joel B. Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: MOSTLY TRUE.Pence is right, according to a report from the Heartland Institute, a conservative policy organization.\u00a0His claim might, however, understate the role of the Second World War, which jump-started the economy \u2014 not through spending, but by relaxing many of the restrictions that had slowed recovery from the Great Depression.So others say it is simply the slowest since World War II, or 1949. Regardless, it has been slow.Kaine\u2019s numbers, by contrast, fell short. He claimed that the Obama administration had created 15 million jobs \u2014 a claim that only works if you ignore the first year of Obama\u2019s presidency, when unemployment continued to rise. Kaine overstated the number of jobs created by some 5 million.None other than the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, disputed the Clinton campaign\u2019s \u201c15 million jobs\u201d talking point: \u201cClinton frequently indicates that she\u2019s talking about the entire Obama administration. She uses phrases such \u2018than when they took office\u2019 or \u2018in the last 7 1/2 years.\u2019 But that\u2019s 5 million jobs too many.\u201dAnd that\u2019s without looking at the decline in household wealth, the rise in the number of Americans who have dropped out of the labor force, and the staggering national debt that produced virtually nothing, jobs-wise, for $10 trillion in deficit spending.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Fact Check, Hillary Clinton, Mike Pence, Tim KaineComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Moreover, they use numbers from last year, where Chicago homicides were far lower than they have been in 2016, to make their case.In other words, instead of comparing Indianapolis\u2019 144 murders in 2015 to Chicago\u2019s 468, The Daily Beast\u00a0compares the cities\u2019 2015 murder rates: 16.9 per 100,000 in Indianapolis, 16.7 per 100,000 in Chicago. Again, however, this completely ignores the fact that there have been 564 murders in Chicago so far this year, according to the Chicago Tribune\u00a0(and it is only October 4).Nevertheless, The Daily Beast contends that Pence ought to be called out for signing a bill that allows concealed carry permit holders to keep guns in their cars in school parking lots for self-defense and also \u201cfor\u00a0arranging for the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard in carrying concealed weapons.\u201dThe Daily Beast is also critical of Pence\u2019s actions which \u201clegalized sawed-off shotguns,\u201d but they fail to note that his actions simply brought Indiana into line with federal law: that people who wish to own a sawed-off shotgun have to go through an extensive background check\u2013including photographs and fingerprints\u2013and have to pay $200 for a federal tax stamp.While calling for Pence to be grilled on Indiana gun violence, The Daily Beast inexplicably points out that Gary, Indiana used to be \u201cknown as the murder capital of America.\u201d That changed on Pence\u2019s watch and even The Daily Beast admits one cause behind the drop in homicides is that \u201ccriminals [in Gary] have joined the exodus for better opportunities elsewhere.\u201dAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

I know this\u2013believe me (to channel my inner Donald). Part of what I do for a living is prepare people\u2019s taxes in the Washington, DC area. As an Enrolled Agent, I run into all sorts of clients. The most political (that is, horse race/hot take) clients compete with performing artists for the least amount of knowledge when it comes to taxes. I\u2019ve even had some of them forget to bring their W-2s to a tax session.That ignorance was on display in vivid colors over the weekend. We were told that this tricky NOL was some sort of \u201cloophole\u201d that only super-rich bad guys like Donald Trump got to use. We were told that this relieved him of having to pay taxes for 18 years, a laughably arbitrary, made up number that is the tautological output of simple arithmetic and wild assumptions.In fact, a net operating loss is very common in businesses. As Alan Cole of the Tax Foundation\u00a0pointed out this morning, about 1 million taxpayers had an NOL in 1995. It results from business deductions exceeding business income in a particular year. Under tax rules, this loss can be carried back up to two years, and carried forward up to twenty years. If this is a \u201cloophole,\u201d what are these political reporters suggesting? That a business loss should simply be eaten by the taxpayer? That Uncle Sam should be a full partner in your profits but not in your losses? How is that fair?We also heard that real estate depreciation\u2013of all things\u2013was a loophole! Could anything be more mundane and ordinary on business tax returns than depreciation deductions? Under the consumption tax base that I and virtually all conservatives support, depreciation would be supplanted by first year full expensing (which, ironically, would cause NOLs in most cases when it comes to structures). But real estate depreciation is no loophole under any theory of tax.Read the rest of the article here.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Taxes, Donald Trump, New York TimesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak2 Oct 20160As Seth Mandel of Commentary notes, the timing of the article is odd: most of the Jewish \u201ctargets\u201d of the piece will be offline.But in the waning hours before the holiday, there is time still to point out the obvious, glaring flaw in Ben Wofford\u2019s article: it completely ignores the obvious and explicit antisemitism that is directly connected to\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.Examples abound. There was the Democratic National Committee\u2019s attempt to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is Jewish,\u00a0over\u00a0his religion. There is Hillary Clinton\u2019s embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement, whose platform accuses Israel of \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2014 an antisemitic claim that turns the victims of the Holocaust into its perpetrators. And there is Clinton\u2019s efforts to promote the writings of Max Blumenthal, an antisemite who is the son of her close associate, Sydney Blumenthal.On a policy level, Clinton backs the disastrous Iran deal, which has sent billions of dollars \u2014 including ransom money \u2014 to a regime that not only promotes Holocaust denial and the hatred of Jews, but which continues to target Jews around the world in terror attacks. And as First Lady, she embraced Yasser Arafat\u2019s wife as\u00a0the latter accused Israel of using poison gas to kill Palestinian women and children.\u00a0As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton faithfully carried out President Barack Obama\u2019s policy of \u201cdistance\u201d from Israel, whose latest snub involved\u00a0\u201ccorrecting\u201d a White House press release about Shimon Peres\u2019s funeral to deny that Jerusalem is, in fact, the capital of Israel.That is not a record of standing up to antisemitism. On the contrary, Clinton has encouraged\u00a0it.Wofford\u2019s case rests entirely on the claim that there are antisemites who support Trump. He ignores the antisemitism among Clinton\u2019s supporters.Lena Dunham, for one, published an article last year titled: \u201cDog or Jewish Boyfriend? A Quiz.\u201d The father of the Orlando terrorist turned up behind Clinton at a recent rally in Florida. And it is no accident that pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activists were in full force at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. They know their party.\u201cI support Palestinian human rights\u201d \u2013 protest signs inside the arena at #DNCinPHL pic.twitter.com/h9D40XoXzo\u2014 Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) July 25, 2016The Politico article treats antisemitism as if it were a new phenomenon, emerging in the 2016 campaign. Has Wofford been on a college campus recently? Antisemitism has been exploding, primarily as a by-product of vicious anti-Israel campaigns.At the University of California Davis last year, Muslim students taunted Jewish students with shouts of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d at a student government meeting. Later, swastikas were found spray-painted on a Jewish fraternity. That was long before Trump.StandWithUs via FacebookThere is certainly antisemitism on the right \u2014 largely online, tweeted by anonymous trolls. The antisemitism on the left is real\u00a0and concrete.But Democrats show little interest in stopping it; indeed, their primary concern is how best to\u00a0turn the vehement activists of the anti-Israel, antisemitic far-left into volunteers and voters.Not a word of that made its way into Politico\u2019s story, which is best described as a partisan smear \u2014 and an attempt to cover up the real nature\u00a0of antisemitism in America today.Joel B.

On her discharge papers, in a box labeled \u201cmedical problem,\u201d a doctor had typed \u201chomicidal ideation.\u201dMelanie thought the whole thing was outrageous. She wasn\u2019t a person with homicidal ideation. She was anxious, sure. Enraged, definitely. But certainly not homicidal, and certainly not in need of a hospital stay.\u201cIt never crossed my mind that I\u2019m losing it,\u201d she said several months after her release, and a big reason for this conviction was the rise of Donald Trump, who had talked about so many of the things she had come to believe \u2014 from Obama being a founder of the terrorist group ISIS, to Hillary Clinton being a co-founder, to the idea that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have been murdered in a White House plot involving a prostitute and a pillow.The woman\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump is recorded in detail:\u201cHere comes Big Daddy,\u201d she said, clapping. \u201cThe Donald. Big Daddy.\u201dKevin was snoring.\u201cHere he is, babe,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald\u2019s here, babe.\u201dTrump walked onto the stage, chanting \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Donald \u2014 USA, baby,\u201d Melanie said to the Republican nominee for president, who began his speech by marveling at all the Americans who had gotten him here.\u201cWho would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16th of last year we \u2014 and I say we, because we are a team \u2014 would have received almost 14 million votes?\u201d Trump said, looking out on the cheering crowd.\u201cI would,\u201d Melanie said to the TV. \u201cI would, Donald.\u201dThe article closes with a very clear implication about the woman\u2019s \u201chead.\u201d\u201cYou winning?\u201d she said, but Kevin was drifting off again, and as Trump went on about \u201chow the system is rigged,\u201d and \u201cwounded American families\u201d and \u201cour own struggling citizens,\u201d Melanie said yes, yes, yes, over and over again, until Trump reached the final three words of his speech.\u201cI love you,\u201d he said.\u201cHe really does love us,\u201d Melanie said, and soon, the balloons were dropping, Trump was waving to the crowd, and she was switching off the television. She didn\u2019t need to hear any more.\u201cIt\u2019s finished,\u201d she said of the 2016 presidential election, in which she was sure Trump would triumph and more and more people across the country would at last see the truth. \u201cIn my head, anyway.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism, Donald TrumpComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The filings show a net loss of $915,729,293 in federal taxable income for the year.That Trump was losing money during the early to mid-1990s \u2014 a period marked by bankruptcies and poor business decisions \u2014 was already well established. But the records obtained by the Times show losses of such a magnitude that they potentially allowed Trump to avoid paying taxes for years, possibly until the end of the last decade.Trump\u2019s campaign released a statement on Saturday lashing out at the Times for publishing the records and accused the newspaper of working to benefit the Republican nominee\u2019s presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.\u201cThe New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,\u201d the campaign said, calling Trump \u201ca highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.\u201dThe statement added that Trump had paid \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in other kinds of taxes over the years.Since 1976, every major party presidential nominee has released tax returns. Clinton has publicly released nearly 40 years\u2019 worth, and Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has released 10 years of his tax returns.But after initially saying that he would make his returns public during the course of his campaign, Trump switched course, citing what he said were years of ongoing IRS audits and the advice of his attorneys to keep them private as those audits proceed.Former IRS officials have expressed skepticism that anyone would be audited so frequently, and they and other tax experts say there\u2019s no prohibition on Trump releasing his returns even if he is.In its story, the Times said the three pages of documents were mailed last month to a Times reporter who had written about Trump\u2019s finances. A postmark indicated they had been sent from New York City and the return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower, the newspaper said.Trump\u2019s campaign did not directly address the authenticity of the excerpts from Trump\u2019s tax filings. Former Trump accountant Jack Mitnick, whose name appears as Trump\u2019s tax preparer of the filings, confirmed their authenticity, the newspaper reported.\u201cThis is legit,\u201d Mitnick told the newspaper.The Times said a lawyer for Trump argued that publication of the records would be illegal because Trump had not authorized their disclosure.Because of provisions in the tax code that allow wealthy individuals to offset their personal income with losses in various partnerships and business ventures, Trump could have used his losses in 1995 to avoid incurring tax liabilities on as many as three years of prior and 15 years of future profits.The $916 million in losses reported by the Times would not include previous years of losses incurred by Trump while his New Jersey casino empire slid into bankruptcy.In an interview, Mitnick told the Times he had sometimes found it odd that the tax code allowed Trump to live in such luxury without paying income taxes.\u201cHere the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,\u201d he said.2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Taxes, Donald Trump, New York TimesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak2 Oct 20160The implication, reinforced by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on\u00a0State of the Union on Sunday morning, is that Trump \u201cavoided\u201d paying taxes, when in fact his tax liability was zero.But the\u00a0Times itself has \u201cavoided\u201d paying taxes \u2014 in 2014, for example.As\u00a0Forbes noted at the time:\u2026 for tax year 2014, The New York Times paid no taxes and got an income tax refund of $3.5 million even though they had a pre-tax profit of $29.9 million in 2014. In other words, their post-tax profit was higher than their pre-tax profit. The explanation in their 2014 annual report\u00a0is, \u201cThe effective tax rate for 2014 was favorably affected by approximately $21.1 million for the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.\u201d If you don\u2019t think it took fancy accountants and tax lawyers to make that happen, read the statement again.New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Trump on Sunday, telling\u00a0NBC News\u2019\u00a0Meet the Press that Trump was a \u201cgenius\u201d in business who was simply doing what the tax code allows every American to do by counting losses against tax liabilities, and bouncing back from failure to success.That would include the\u00a0New York Times \u2014 which, however, is still struggling.As Jazz Shaw of HotAir.com\u00a0notes, the\u00a0Times\u00a0\u2014 or whoever was its source \u2014 likely obtained Trump\u2019s tax document illegally.The ongoing IRS scandal, in which the federal government targeted conservative organizations, involved\u00a0several cases in which the agency illegally shared taxpayer information with other branches of government, and in one case leaked taxpayer information to a conservative organization\u2019s political opponents.In 2008, the confidential tax information of Joe \u201cthe Plumber\u201d Wurzelbacher, who emerged as a critic of then-Sen. Barack Obama, was leaked illegally by an Ohio state official.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Pollak2 Oct 20160Clinton\u2019s comments, recorded at a fundraiser in McLean, VA in February and published by the Washington Free Beacon, also included several other digs at Sanders and his fans, saying that he was offering them a \u201cfalse promise.\u201d But Sanders, far from taking offense, confirmed Clinton\u2019s condescending remarks.Clinton had said (emphasis added):Some are new to politics completely. They\u2019re children of the Great Recession.\u00a0And they are living in their parents\u2019 basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don\u2019t see much of a future.Appearing on CNN\u2019s\u00a0State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Sanders said (emphasis added):Well, I agree with her. What she is saying is what I suggested a moment ago. There are young people who went deeply into debt, worked very hard to get a good education, and yet they are getting out of school and can\u2019t find decent, paying jobs. And that is\u00a0a major problem. They are living in their parents\u2019 basements. So that\u2019s the point there. So I personally do believe we do need a political revolution. That we do need to transform this society; create decent, paying jobs, make sure Donald Trump and his billionaire friends start paying their fair share of taxes; do what Donald Trump does not want us to do, address the crisis of climate change; transform our energy system, do what Donald Trump does not want us to do; raise the minimum wage to a living wage; and have pay equity for women. So I think that Secretary Clinton \u2014 and by the way, as I said, I just talked to her a few days ago, she is prepared on all of those issues to move forward within the first 100 days of her administration. And\u00a0on top of that, unlike Donald Trump, she understands that Citizens United\u00a0Supreme Court decision is undermining American democracy. It has got to be overturned. She will be supporting the constitutional amendment to do that so that billionaires cannot continue buying elections in this country.Asked by Tapper what he would say to a supporter who found it condescending to be described as a \u201cbasement-dwelling barista that is buying false promises from Bernie Sanders,\u201d Sanders said that supporters should choose between the candidates based on their positions on the issues.Joel B.

In July,\u00a0PolitiFact staff writer\u00a0Linda Qiu\u00a0published a piece full of\u00a0factual errors, glaring inaccuracies, and omissions.Breitbart News published a\u00a0full-scale 13-point refutation of the last Politifact Uranium One piece, which the latest one references.Kertscher\u2019s piece, however, is more of the same sloppy script.Several of the\u00a013 refutation points still apply to this latest \u201cfact-check\u201d article, but below are two additional points that deserve attention:1. It\u2019s true that the\u00a0Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has nine agencies that approved the sale of American uranium reserves. However, only one of those agencies, the Hillary Clinton-led State Department, employed a person whose family foundation collected\u00a0$145 million from investors in the deal \u2014 an alarming conflict of interest.2. PolitiFact says, \u201cGiven that Russia doesn\u2019t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One\u2019s assets in Kazakhstan, the world\u2019s largest uranium producer, our colleagues said.\u201dHowever, according to The New York Times,\u00a0that is patently false.As The New York Times\u00a0reports,\u00a0\u201cThe commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellow cake\u00a0to Canada even though it does not have an export license.\u201dThe\u00a0Times\u00a0report continues:Mr. Christensen, 65, noted that despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license \u2014 which they do not have \u2014 yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada.Asked about that, the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that \u201cto the best of our knowledge\u201d most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan. At the moment, with the uranium market in a downturn, nothing is being shipped from the Wyoming mines.The \u201cno export\u201d assurance given at the time of the Rosatom deal is not the only one that turned out to be less than it seemed. Despite pledges to the contrary, Uranium One was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and taken private. As of 2013, Rosatom\u2019s subsidiary, ARMZ, owned 100 percent of it.Read\u00a0PolitiFact\u2019s most recent \u201cfact check\u201d in full here.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\u00a0@JeromeEHudson.Big Journalism, Hillary Clinton, Pre-Viral, 2016 presidential race, big journalism, Clinton Cash, Hillary Clinton, Politifact, Uranium OneComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak30 Sep 20160The scathing editorial, \u201cBystanders to Genocide,\u201d repeats what Breitbart News observed even before Power was confirmed in 2013 \u2014 that she was doing nothing to stop the slaughter in Syria, in deference\u00a0her political masters.The\u00a0Journal notes that Power built her career as a pundit, and later as a policymaker, through her published works on the Rwandan genocide \u2014 and American neglect:Ms. Power knows something about barbarism and responsibility. In 2001 she published a searing account in the Atlantic about the Clinton Administration\u2019s failure to stop the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, in which as many as 800,000 Tutsis were killed over three months by their Hutu neighbors.Ms. Power spared no one in her depiction of the Administration\u2019s \u201calmost willful delusion\u201d about the killing, its diplomatic prevarications to avoid using the word \u201cgenocide,\u201d and its concern with how U.S. intervention would play in the midterm elections. She was particularly tough on U.S. officials who \u201cwere firmly convinced that they were doing all they could\u2014and, most important, all they should\u2014in light of competing American interests and a highly circumscribed understanding of what was \u2018possible\u2019 for the United States to do.\u201dThe essay was titled \u201cBystanders to Genocide.\u201d Ms. Power later expanded the article into a book, \u201cA Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide,\u201d for which she was widely praised. Barack Obama read the book and promoted her rise in government.Now, however, the Journal notes,\u00a0\u201cMs. Power can sound like those officials she once scolded for thinking they were doing everything they could given the complexities of the situation.\u201d It slams\u00a0some of her recent excuses for inaction, such as the complexity of the war on the ground.The war was\u00a0far\u00a0simpler when Power (and President Barack Obama) had the chance to\u00a0take decisive action, both in the early days of the Arab Spring in 2011 and after Syria violated Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons in 2013.The\u00a0Journal concludes that \u201cPower\u00a0has become an echo of the officials she once denounced for justifying American inaction in the face of mass slaughter. The honorable decision would be to resign.\u201dBreitbart News urged Power to resign in 2013, when she was still a national security adviser at the White House, in charge of a useless committee called the Atrocities Prevention Board that did nothing about Syria.The\u00a0Journal now agreed.

Pollak30 Sep 20160Donald Trump had just taken over the pageant, and fought to deal with the fallout.Hillary Clinton has, for months, planned to use that episode against him, training Machado for the attack. Here are the facts.1. Trump fought to save Machado\u2019s Miss Universe title, and her job. What is a sensitive feminist male boss supposed to do if a female employee \u2014 hired, again, for her appearance \u2014 gains a large amount of weight? He is supposed to defend her job. And that is exactly what Trump did, urging the pageant not to fire her, and appearing with her at a gym to offer support. In an excerpt from his book The Art of the Comeback, Rush Limbaugh noted Thursday, Trump recalled the episode:\u201cFirst, she wins. Second, she gains fifty pounds. Third, I urged the committee not to fire her. Fourth, I go to the gym with her in a show of support. Final act: She trashes me in the Washington Post \u2014 after I stood by her the entire time. What\u2019s wrong with this picture? Anyway, the best part about the evening was the knowledge that next year she would no longer be Miss Universe. What\u2019s maddening is that I supported her.\u201cEven in Palm Beach, where I haven\u2019t always gotten the greatest press, Shannon Donnelly, society columnist for the Palm Beach Daily News,\u201d known here as the Shiny Sheet, \u201cwrote, \u2018Here\u2019s a new one for the Donald: Protector-Advocate for large women. His acquisition from ITT has put Alicia Machado under the Trump Aegis. The Donald, bless his heart, doesn\u2019t want to fire her because \u201cit would be a terrible message to send.\u201d He is instead bringing her to the spa at Mar-a-Lago where she can work out in earnest, eat sensibly and generally decompress.\u2019 That sounds pretty gentlike to me.\u201d2. A Venezuelan judge accused Machado of threatening to kill him. From a 1998 news report: \u201cMachado, who grabbed world headlines for nearly losing her crown after a sudden weight gain, burst back into the limelight last month when lawyers named her as the getaway driver for her boyfriend in a shooting last November \u2026 [Judge Maximiliano] Fuenmayor, who reported the alleged threats to police, said he traced the caller through an incoming call identity function on his mobile telephone.\u201d The New York Post repored at the time that Machado \u201cwas seen driving the car in which her boyfriend, Juan Rodriguez Reggeti, sped away after shooting his brother-in-law in the head in Caracas on Nov. 21,\u201d citing the victim\u2019s family\u2019s lawyer. (He survived.) Machado denied the charges, which were later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence.3. Machado damaged her own reputation by having sex live on television. In 2005, Machado appeared on The Farm, a Spanish-language version of the Big Brother program. She had sex with the host of the show, even though she was engaged to Major League Baseball player Bobby Abreu of the Philadelphia Phillies at the time. Abreu called off the wedding after the humiliating episode aired on TV. Machado wrote of\u00a0her new lover, according to the Sun: \u201cHe treats me like a goddess, he f***s me like a b****!\u201d In 2006, she became the first Miss Universe to pose nude for\u00a0Playboy, appearing in\u00a0Playboy Mexico.4. The Clinton campaign has been coaching Machado for months to attack Trump. From the Washington Post:Operatives in Brooklyn had been working with Machado since the summer. They had a video featuring her story ready to go. Cosmopolitan had a photo spread of her draped in an American flag \u2013 to go with a profile \u2013 in the can. Machado had also conducted an interview with The Guardian that was \u201capparently embargoed for post-debate release,\u201d according to Vox. And the Clinton super PAC Priorities USA turned a digital ad to highlight the insults by early afternoon.5. Machado did, in fact, gain weight during her reign as Miss Universe. The Economist reported that she put on \u201c15 kilos within weeks of winning her title.\u201d Other newspapers called her \u201cThe Incredible Bulk.\u201d What was at issue was not her weight or appearance, but that she had just won a competition in which she voluntarily submitted herself to be judged for both \u2014 against hundreds of other contestants who would have taken her place. The Orlando Sentinel wrote: \u201cNo one, of course, raised an eyebrow when Machado basically starved herself before the competition. But when she gained anywhere from a reported 22 to 50 pounds afterward, she caused quite the international stir.\u201d Trump denies calling her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d or \u201cMiss Housekeeping,\u201d as Machado now claims (though he is on record at the time having called her an \u201ceating machine\u201d). Machado told the\u00a0Miami Herald\u00a0that before the beauty pageant,\u00a0\u201cI was anorexic and bulimic, but almost all of us are.\u201dJoel B.

The\u00a0Times added: \u201cNo candidate since 1960 has made it to the White House without winning Ohio. And while Mrs. Clinton could afford to lose there given her advantage in other battlegrounds like Virginia and Colorado, Ohio is a must-win for Mr. Trump.\u201dNow that Trump is winning the \u201cmust-win,\u201d the\u00a0Times has revised its view of Ohio\u2019s importance: \u201cAfter decades as one of America\u2019s most reliable political bellwethers, an inevitable presidential battleground that closely mirrored the mood and makeup of the country, Ohio is suddenly fading in importance this year,\u201d writes Jonathan Martin, who notes that Clinton has basically conceded the state.\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s unyielding anti-trade campaign and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s difficulty energizing Ohio\u2019s young voters have made it a lesser focus for Democrats this year, even as it remains critical to Mr. Trump\u2019s path to the White House,\u201d he explains (emphasis added).That bit of revisionist history is necessary to avoid drawing the alternative conclusion, which is that Trump\u2019s success in the bellwether state of Ohio could portend success elsewhere as well.Joel B.

She has now hired an unspecified number of former Secret Service agents as part of the effort to \u201c[amp] up her security to Presidential levels.\u201d The security detail will reportedly include \u201cone team of 2 hired muscles (minimum) everywhere she goes\u201d and the car in which she travels will be \u201carmored.\u201dThe move comes after the 35-year-old Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was robbed at gunpoint by masked men in her Paris hotel room during Paris Fashion Week. The thieves \u2014 who remain at large \u2014 reportedly stole $5.6 million worth of jewelry, including a diamond ring given to Kardashian by her husband Kanye West said to be worth $4 million.AFP reported that Kardashian was \u201cbadly shaken but physically unharmed\u201d after the incident, during which she was reportedly bound and gagged.It is noteworthy to contrast Kardashian\u2019s approach to her personal security with her campaign for more gun control for law-abiding citizens; the former relies on good guys with guns to keep her safe, while the latter makes it harder for good guys to get guns to keep themselves safe.After\u00a0the June 17, 2015, firearm-based attack on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Kardashian voiced support\u00a0for\u00a0\u201cstricter legislation to prevent mass shootings.\u201d The\u00a0Daily Mail quoted her saying, \u201cI\u2019m not the type to have them (guns) in my house, they scare me so much,\u201d yet she did not hesitate to push for increased gun control measures as something she believed would \u201cchange the world.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really a gun person, and we do not have strict enough gun control laws,\u201d she reportedly said.Kardashian appeared to have\u00a0missed the fact that gun laws in Paris are among the most strict\u00a0in the world, but this did not prevent terrorists from acquiring guns and killing 12 people in the January 7, 2015 attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Moreover, on November 13, 2015 \u2014 months after Kardashian described gun control as something that could \u201cchange the world\u201d \u2014 armed terrorists shot and killed 130 people in gun-controlled Paris.On June 12, the day an attacker shot and killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Kardashian suggested the US needs stronger laws to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists.\u00a0 She tweeted:\u00a0\u201cUnder current federal law people on terror watch lists can legally buy guns \u2013 this is called the Terror Gap.\u201d But Kardashian apparently missed the fact that the Orlando attacker was not on a terror watch list; therefore, including the terror watch list in background checks would not have hindered, much less prevented, the Orlando attack.As recently as August 5, 2016, Kardashian and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe\u00a0met with family members of gun violence victims at an event organized\u00a0by the Michael Bloomberg-funded Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety. Two months later, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint while in Paris, a city with gun control that exceeds the laws\u00a0Kardashian has advocated for in the United States.Kardashian will apparently\u00a0surround herself with more good guys with guns for safety, but has not recanted her efforts to make it harder for good guys to acquire guns with which to defend themselves.\u00a0AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Sorry all.\u2014 Jesse Lehrich (@JesseLehrich) October 10, 2016\u00a010:30: Clinton promises to defend coal miners but is not pressed about her comments about wanting to put the coal miners out of business. Trump had to bring that point up. She slams Trump for using steel that the Chinese dumped.10:27: Trump wonders how Clinton made so much money after leaving elected office. He says Clinton made millions because of the power of her office and wonders why she isn\u2019t putting any of her money into the campaign\u2026 Trump says he is not beholden to special interests like Clinton.Scene in the spin room right now \u2014 reporters waiting to see who will enter pic.twitter.com/ww5s4f1VIe\u2014 MaryAlice Parks (@maryaliceparks) October 10, 201610:24: Raddatz keeps interrupting Trump and says \u201cwe have to get the audience\u201d after she monopolized parts of the debate.10:21: Cooper asks about Trump about \u201cdiscipline\u201d and his early morning Tweets about a former Miss Universe\u2019s alleged sex tape. Trump says \u201cTweeting happens to be a modern-day form of communication.\u201d He says it\u2019s a \u201cvery effective way of communication.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not un-proud of it,\u201d he says.When asked if Trump has the discipline to be president, Clinton says, \u201cno.\u201d She says it\u2019s in part because \u201cthose of who have had the great privilege to see this job up close and know how difficult it is.\u201d10:20: Raddatz again giving people distrustful of the mainstream press every reason to\u00a0continue to do so.Why is Raddatz debating trump?Isnt that hillarys job?\u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) October 10, 201610:18: Cooper presses Clinton on her \u201cdeplorables\u201d comment. He asks how can Clinton unite a country if she has written off tens of millions of Americans. Clinton says her argument is not with his supporters but with Trump and his \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cdivisive comments.\u201d She claims Trump \u201cincites violence\u201d at rallies. No mention of left-wing agitators who attacked Trump supporters in places like Chicago and Northern California.Trump on Clinton: \"Believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. When she said 'deplorables,' she meant it\" https://t.co/ItN1OKNjif\u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 10, 201610:14:\u00a0Trump, in response to questioner, who asks about whether the candidates can be a devoted president for all Americans.. says Clinton\u00a0has called Americans \u201cdeplorables\u201d and he will be a president for \u201call Americans.\u201d He says he will be the president for \u201call of the people.\u201d Trump talks about the inner cities and says politicians talk about helping African-Americans and Hispanics in the inner cities and they do \u00a0nothing about it. Clinton lists her accomplishments with the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and helping underserved communities in the South. Clinton again brings up the so-called Trump Effect (the study was unscientific).10:13: Trump points out that when Clinton goes a minute over her allowed time, nobody interrupts. He says the moderators interrupt the second he goes over his time.10:12: Clinton says it\u2019s not \u201csmart strategy\u201d for American forces to be occupying Syria. She says Trump claims he knows more about ISIS than the generals. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t\u201d she says.10:07: Trump says almost everything Clinton has done in foreign policy has been a \u201cmistake\u201d and \u201cdisaster.\u201d Trump says Clinton made Iran powerful with possibly \u201cthe dumbest deal I have ever seen.\u201d Trump says Iran and Russia are now against us. Trump now says Clinton doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. He says he doesn\u2019t know Assad but at least he\u2019s killing ISIS. Raddatz keeps trying to make Trump bad by acting like a know-it-all college professor who knows more than the candidate (this is why the public hates the mainstream press). It seems like Trump is debating Raddatz instead of Clinton.\u00a0\"He and I haven't spoken and I disagree,\" says @realDonaldTrump of @mike_pence on possible Syria intervention. @MarthaRaddatz everyone.\u2014 Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) October 10, 201610:06:Hillary's got the fly vote https://t.co/CO3sSbsUIK\u2014 Best Vines (@TheFunnyVine) October 10, 2016My first time on live television. #HilaryClintonFly pic.twitter.com/KaFOw2an0j\u2014 Hilary Clinton Fly (@fly_hilary) October 10, 201610:05: Clinton is asked about Syria. Online questioner makes comparison\u00a0to the Holocaust. Clinton says there is a determined effort by the Russians to destroy \u201cAleppo\u201d to get rid of the last of the rebels against Assad. She says she has advocated no-fly and safe zones.10:03: Is this debate about the moderators or the actual supposedly \u201cundecided\u201d voters? There doesn\u2019t seem to be that much engagement with the actual voters in the room.9:58: Cooper grills Trump on taxes. He says he used deductions in the tax code that people like Clinton allowed. She says Clinton has wealthy friends who want to keep the carried interest provisions in place. Trump says he pays tax and federal income tax. Trump says Clinton is \u201call talk and no action.\u201d He keeps bringing up Sanders\u2019s quote about Clinton\u2019s \u201cbad judgment.\u201d He now slams Clinton for creating the vacuum in the Middle East that allowed ISIS to form. \u201cCongratulations, great job,\u201d Trump says. Clinton says she has been in favor of getting rid of carried interests. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do it?\u201d Trump asks. Clinton says because she was a Senator with a Republican President. \u201cUnder our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power,\u201d Clinton shoots back.9:55: Clinton says Trump lives in an \u201calternative reality\u201d and \u201ceverything Trump has said is not true.\u201d Clinton implies Trump may not have paid taxes for 20 years and she says \u201cDonald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald.\u201d She accuses Trump of wanting to help the rich with his tax plan. It seems like Clinton doesn\u2019t know anything about Trump\u2019s tax plan and is just repeating typical Dem. talking points about Republicans on taxes. Clinton wants the Buffet rule and a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. She claims she wants to invest in hard-working families.9:54: Trump says Clinton has been there for 30 years and the system has never changed and will never change under Clinton.[Trump should use this opportunity to frame this election as one between an outsider versus consummate insider but he just is not adept at framing the race in ways he should.[9:53: Questioner asks what he would change in the tax code to ensure that the wealthy \u201cpay their fair share.\u201d Trump says he would \u201cknock out the tax code\u201d and get rid of the \u201ccarried interest provision.\u201d[These are \u201cundecided\u201d voters?]9:51: \u201cHonest Abe never lied,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.\u201d He says Clinton got caught lying after the Wikileaks dump and is now blaming Lincoln for her lies. Trump says he has no loans from Russia and doesn\u2019t know anything about the country\u2019s inner workings. He points out that the U.S. government has seen his balance sheet and chose him to do the Old Post Office building. After Clinton calls on Trump to release his taxes, Trump says \u00a0people like Warren Buffet and George Soros took \u201cmassive deductions.\u201d He says he would be \u201cvery proud\u201d to release his taxes after his routine audit is done.9:48: Clinton now claims that her comments about private/public positions was in reference to Lincoln. [What spin!] She now says Russians are engaged in hacking to get Trump elected and talks up Trump\u2019s praise of Putin. Moderators let Clinton talk, talk, talk off-topic again before Raddatz FINALLY interrupts for one of the first times.I'm told the women Trump invited to the debate are set to appear in the post-debate spin room, per campaign aide. #debate\u2014 Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 10, 20169:45: Clinton claims that terrorist recruiters are using Trump\u2019s words to recruit more terrorists. Trump points out that Clinton went 25 seconds over her time and the moderators didn\u2019t interrupt. Trump points out that Clinton, when she was Secretary of State, didn\u2019t force countries to accept illegal immigrants who committed crimes like murder. Trump says drugs are pouring through our Southern border \u201cat a record clip\u201d and Clinton doesn\u2019t understand the border and wants amnesty. Trump says Clinton\u2019s judgment is so bad that she should never be president.[Now would be a good time for Trump to point out Clinton\u2019s wikileaks emails about open borders and her need for public/private positions. Raddatz transitions to the question from a voter about whether it is okay for a politician to be two-faced.]9:43: Raddatz helps Clinton even in her questioning, saying \u201cwe know you want tougher vetting.\u201d Again, the moderators are like rasslin\u2019 announcers doing their best to make Clinton get \u201cover\u201d with the audience while trying to turn Trump into the \u201cheel\u201d that that audience hates. Is Trump skilled enough to be the anti-hero and heel that rasslin\u2019 crowds started to love in the Attitude Era like Stone Cold Steve Austin?9:41: Clinton says \u201cwe are not at war with Islam.\u201d \u00a0She says she wants a country where citizens like you are welcome just like everyone else. Raddatz piles on, again pressing Trump on his Muslim ban. She asks if Trump supports the Muslim ban. Trump says if he had been president, Captain Kahn would have been alive today because he would not have gone into Iraq like Clinton. He calls him an \u201cAmerican hero.\u201d Raddatz keeps grilling Trump. The moderators have hardly interrogated Clinton tonight. Trump keeps trying to explain his \u201cextreme vetting\u201d program and says Clinton wants more Syrian refugees. \u201cThe great Trojan Horse of all time,\u201d he says. Trump says he doesn\u2019t want hundreds of thousands of people from Syria coming in when we don\u2019t know nothing about their values or their love for our country.\u00a09:39: Clinton thanks the questioner for asking the question. She says there have been \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d things said about Muslims. She brings up Trump\u2019s attacks on the Kahn family. Clinton talks about the country\u2019s famous Muslims and says we just lost one in Muhammad Ali. Clinton says it\u2019s short-sighted and \u201cdangerous\u201d for Trump to be engaged in demagogic comments about Muslims.[These are \u201cUNDECIDED\u201d voters?]9:37: Muslim questioner asks Trump about Islamophobia. \u201cYou\u2019re right about islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Trump says, again showing that he wants to appease whomever is speaking to him. But he says we have to get Muslims to report what they see in their communities. Trump now says Clinton and Obama won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and \u201cbefore you solve it, you have to say the name.\u201d9:36: Cooper grills Trump on specifics re: Obamacare/health \u00a0(he wants to know how he would get insurance companies to insure uninsured people without a mandate) care while Hillary Clinton smirks as Trump is under fire.9:32: Trump says Obamacare is a disaster and is only getting worse. He says Obamacare is expensive for those who have it and unbelievably expensive for the country. He says we have to replace it with something that is less expensive and words. He again talks about getting rid of the lines around the states. He says Clinton wants a single-payer plan like Canada and has been after this for years. He says Obamacare is just the first step.[Trump did not mention that Bill Clinton called it crazy. Anderson Cooper had to do that. Again, lack of preparation showing for Trump.]9:29: Questioner asks about Obamacare. Cooper tries to give Clinton the first bite at the apple. After Trump starts to answer, Clinton says let him take it. Trump says he\u2019s a gentleman so he will allow Clinton to answer. She says what Donald would have said was that he would repeal it while she will \u201cfix it.\u201d Clinton says people can\u2019t be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions and there are no lifetime limits under Obamacare. She says people under 24 can be on their parents\u2019s plans under Obamacare. She says, though, small businesses need additional help. Clinton says if we repeal Obamacare, \u201call of those benefits are lost to everybody\u2026\u201d [Classic. Put in a government program and make it impossible to repeal once folks need the benefits.]9:28: \u201cOkay, Donald,\u201d Clinton says. She says Trump wants to do anything to avoid talking about his \u201cexploding campaign\u201d and GOP establishment Republicans deserting him. Trump says the debate once again is a one-on-three battle.9:27: Trump says Clinton is again \u201clying\u201d about her deleted 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena. \u201cI am so disappointed in Congressman, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen,\u201d Trump says. He blasts Bill Clinton for talking to Attorney General Loretta Lynch nearly a month before the matter was decided.9:25: Clinton says he email scandal was a \u201cmistake\u201d and she\u2019s not \u201cmaking any excuses about it.\u201dcrowd in hall laughed when @HillaryClinton tried to say it was true that she deleted 30,000 emails #debate #debate2016\u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) October 10, 2016[Trump has an opportunity to say this election is about his words vs. a candidate who endangered the country\u2019s national security with her private email server. Will he?]9:24: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Trump says after Clinton says she\u2019s glad someone with Trump\u2019s temperament who is in charge of enforcing the country\u2019s laws.9:23: Trump says people\u2019s lives have been destroyed for doing a fifth of what Clinton has done and she should be ashamed of her actions. Clinton now says \u201ceverything\u201d Trump says was absolutely false re: her private emails.9:19: Clinton claims what \u201cso much of what Trump said is not right.\u201d A very legalese answer. She says \u201cso much\u201d but not \u201call\u201d or \u201ceverything\u201d as she tries to evade the question. She quotes Michelle Obama about going high when they go low. Clinton\u00a0says everyone can draw their conclusions about the man in the video or the man on stage respects women. Clinton now brings up the Kahn family to evade the question. Funny, the moderators aren\u2019t interrupting her like they did with Trump. Clinton brings up Judge Curiel. She accuses Trump of mocking a disabled reporter. She brings up Trump\u2019s \u201cracist lie\u201d that Obama was not born in the United States. Clinton says Trump has never apologized and owes Obama an apology. Trump says she owes Obama an apology because the Clinton campaign and her allies started the birther controversy. Trump now brings up some vicious commercials Michelle Obama cut in 2008 about Hillary Clinton. He now says Obama defeated her \u201cfair and square\u201d but Clinton didn\u2019t defeat Obama fairly because the election was rigged, citing the Wikileaks email dump. Trump says if he wins, he is going to instruct the Attorney General to get a \u201cspecial prosecutor to look into your situation.\u201d\u00a09:17: Raddatz again grills Trump on the tape. Trump says he is not proud of the tape and is a person who has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for people. Trump says if you look at Bill Clinton, \u201cmine are words\u201d and \u201chis are actions.\u201d Trump says nobody in the history of politics have been as \u201cabusive to women\u201d as Bill Clinton. Trump says Hillary Clinton attacked those victims viciously. Trump now informs the world that Hilary Clinton laughed at a 12-year-old rape victim. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me about words,\u201d Trump says. \u201cBut what President Clinton did\u2026 When Hillary brings up a point like that\u2026. I think it\u2019s disgraceful and she ought to be ashamed of herself.\u201d9:12: Cooper gives Clinton a chance to respond. She says she has spent the past 48 hours thinking about the tape. Clinton says she has never questioned the fitness of other GOP candidates to serve and she says \u201cDonald Trump is different.\u201d She says Trump is \u201cnot fit to serve\u201d as president. She says Trump claimed the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is but \u201cit represents exactly who he is.\u201d Clinton says Trump has insulted women and ranked women on their appearances while also embarrassing women on television and Twitter. She blasts Trump for \u201cdenigrating a former Miss Universe\u201d in harsh and vulgar terms. Clinton says it\u2019s not only the video that raises questions about Trump\u2019s fitness. She accuses Trump now of attacking minorities as well as she desperately tries to cobble together the Obama coalition. [Once again, Clinton schooling Trump on how to pivot. Trump should have said that though he made inappropriate comments, America needs someone who puts America first instead of the special interests and globalists. He needs to frame the election in this manner.]Trump shoots back on HRC says \"it's just words, folks, it's just words\"\u2014 Lauren Blanchard (@LaurenBlanch12) October 10, 20169:10: Cooper now brings up Trump\u2019s tape. Cooper says Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Trump says this is \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d He says he is not proud of it and has apologized for it. Trump\u00a0says he will knock the hell out of ISIS. Cooper keeps pressing Trump on the tape. He says he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for women while Cooper keeps pressing him on whether he has touched women without their consent. \u201cNo, I have not,\u201d Trump says before pivoting back to needing borders and making America safe and wealthy again.9:08: Trump says he entered the campaign because he got tired of seeing \u201cfoolish\u201d things being done by politicians. He brings up Obamacare, the Iran Deal (\u201cone-sided transaction\u201d with a \u201cterrorist state\u201d). Trump says America has tremendous potential and brings up the country\u2019s massive trade deficit. He says we\u2019re going to have a \u201cstrong border\u201d and \u201cbring back law and order.\u201d \u201cWe have to bring back respect to law enforcement,\u201d he says. Trump says he wants to do things that haven\u2019t been done, like fixing the inner cities to help African-Americans and Latinos/Hispanics.9:06: First questioner asks Clinton about how the last debate could have been rated \u201cMA\u201d and whether the candidates\u2019s behavior is appropriate for today\u2019s youth? (Clinton\u2019s lies re: her private email server is model behavior?) This gives Clinton a perfect opportunity to go over her talking points on a range of issues on various policy issues re: wanting to be a president for \u201call Americans.\u201d9:05: Trump and Clinton walk on stage. They seem tense and don\u2019t shake hands.\u00a09:02:Bill Clinton and Melania Trump shake hands along with the Trump family. #Debates #DebateNight pic.twitter.com/HCYM6KB5IZ\u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) October 10, 20168:58: Dana Bash in CNN points out that Bill Clinton does not have a good poker face, and he looks very, very uncomfortable tonight at the debate, especially since women who have accused him of sexual assault are in the audience with him.Bill Clinton accusers were just seated in the debate hall right in front of @SenatorDurbin : pic.twitter.com/yQSSVuKyEu\u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 10, 20168:57: Moderators Cooper and Raddatz now being introduced as the debate is about to begin.8:55: Coulter making great points:You have to ask yourself:  Why are the media & politicians so desperate to stop Donald Trump?

Why? The bottom line is Hillary Clinton is still a deeply flawed candidate who cannot connect well with voters. In addition, her support of open borders and globalist-first policies have prevented many undecided voters, especially working-class voters, from going to her side. And that\u2019s why, despite all of Trump\u2019s flaws, many of which have been self-inflicted, he still seems like the football team that is only one possession away in the second half from tying up the game despite having committed turnover after turnover throughout the game.2016 Presidential Race, Big HollywoodComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Parker and his college roommate and Birth co-writer Jean Celestin were accused of rape while at Penn State in 1999; Parker was ultimately acquitted of the charges, while Celestin was convicted but had his conviction overturned on appeal.The controversy caused a massive headache for the studio, which had hoped the film would be a favorite at this year\u2019s Academy Awards. Fox Searchlight initially worked to limit Parker\u2019s media appearances while some screenings of the film were cancelled amid growing backlash.Parker had mostly been kept out of the film\u2019s marketing activity until last week, when he sat for a\u00a0pair of television interviews on 60 Minutes and Good Morning America.\u201cI was falsely accused, I was proven innocent and I\u2019m not going to apologize for that,\u201d an unrepentant Parker told GMA host Robin Roberts last week when asked about the case.Meanwhile, the Hollywood Reporter reported that Fox Searchlight \u2014 which also conducted a voter registration drive ahead of showings of the film in small movie theaters in swing states \u2014 will now focus its awards efforts on its other buzzed-about upcoming film, the Natalie Portman-starring Jaqueline Kennedy biopic Jackie.Birth of a Nation \u2014 also starring Armie Hammer, Penelope Ann Miller, Jackie Earle Haley, Colman Domingo, Aja Naomi King and Gabrielle Union \u2014 scored a solid 79 percent from critics on Rotten Tomatoes and an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.The weekend\u2019s other new wide release, Lionsgate/CBS Films\u2019 teen-targeted Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life, brought in an estimated $6.9 million from 2,822 theaters.Holdovers Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children, Deepwater Horizon, The Magnificent Seven and Storks were projected to finish\u00a0in second, third, fourth and fifth place, respectively.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, box office, Fox Searchlight, Jackie, Nate Parker, The Birth of a Nation, The Girl on the TrainComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Carlin on Thursday, Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) asked the DOJ to review and update\u00a0the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) in response to a significant rise in Chinese investment in Hollywood.In his letter, Culberson specifically cites the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda\u2019s acquisition of AMC Cinemas and Legendary Entertainment in the U.S. and its bid for Carmike Cinemas, along with\u00a0Hunan TV\u2019s investment in Lionsgate.Wanda acquired Legendary \u2014 the studio behind such films as Jurassic World\u00a0and\u00a0Godzilla \u2014 for $3.5 billion in January, and purchased a majority stake in AMC in May 2012 for $2.6 billion in cash.Culberson warned that the multi-billion dollar acquisitions \u201callow Chinese state-controlled companies a significant degree of control over the financing and content of American media that raises serious concerns about how this may be used for propaganda purposes.\u201dGerry Lopez, CEO of AMC Entertainment Holdings, left, shakes hands with Zhang Lin, Vice President of Wanda during a signing ceremony for Dalian Wanda Group Co. to acquire AMC Entertainment Holdings in Beijing, China, Monday, May 21, 2012. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)Culberson praised the DOJ in his letter for its warm reception of an Inspector General\u2019s audit of FARA which was published in September. The report recommended 14 changes to FARA \u2014 which was first implemented in 1938 in response to fears of Soviet or Nazi propaganda infiltration in America \u2014 to bring the regulations up to date, after its last review in 1990.The lawmaker also cited a report released by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission last October that found, according to Culberson, a number of \u201ctroubling examples of how agents of the Chinese Communist Party are exerting control of American movie content, both through direct ownership of studios and distribution as well as through coerced cooperation\u201d with Chinese government censorship agencies.Culberson went on to call attention to Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin, whom he says \u201cdoes not try to hide his close relationship with the Chinese government.\u201d The congressman said the DOJ would need to update FARA to address \u201cnew threats.\u201d\u201cIf, in fact, the law in its current form no longer effectively addresses these concerns, I urge you to provide legislative options Congress may consider to ensure transparency, full disclosure, and to mitigate this type of foreign propaganda influence over American media, which shapes not only the opinions of many within the U.S. but remains one of our biggest cultural exports to nations around the world,\u201d Culberson concluded his letter.The Texas lawmaker was one of 16 Congress members who last month asked the GAO to determine whether existing U.S. law had kept pace with rising foreign acquisitions in\u00a0the U.S. and particularly in\u00a0the entertainment industry. The lawmakers\u2019 letter to the GAO had also cited Wanda\u2019s purchase of AMC Theaters and Legendary Entertainment. The GAO agreed to review the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States in response to the lawmakers\u2019 petition.Culberson\u2019s letter comes after the Washington Post editorial board on Wednesday night questioned Wanda\u2019s interest in a billion-dollar acquisition of the U.S.-based Dick Clark Productions, which produces awards shows including the Golden Globes and the American Music Awards.\u201cIt is not far-fetched to assume that China would seek to spread pro-regime propaganda via ownership of U.S. entertainment media,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial board wrote.Read Culberson\u2019s full letter to the DOJ here.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Government, Big Hollywood, AMC Cinemas, Dalian Wanda, Department of Justice, John Culberson, Legendary Entertainment, propaganda, Wang JianlinComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Issues including\u00a0gun control policy, race relations, and Clinton\u2019s preference of pizza crust were handpicked by the campaign.The interview began with an audience member asking a question meant to tout\u00a0Clinton\u00a0as \u201cexpert\u201d grandmother.\u201cHi Steve. I\u2019m a grandmother of 12 kids so by now I\u2019m running out of fun things to do with them,\u201d audience member Robin Rick was instructed to say to Harvey, according to the memo. \u201cI\u2019m looking for new ways to entertain them so I was wondering, since Marjorie is a grandmother like me what are some of her favorite things to do with your grandkids?\u201dAs advised in the memo, Clinton was then introduced to the audience by Harvey. \u201cYou will enter the stage and assist Steve in Answering the question,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cAt this point he will show the picture of you and President Clinton holding Charlotte for the first time.\u201dThe memo acknowledges how the Clinton campaign believed Harvey\u2019s show to be a politically safe space, where Clinton could\u00a0easily\u00a0attract the attention of\u00a0female and African American voters.Harvey was instructed to \u201cfield 2-3 questions on his own\u201d while \u201cthe 3rd or 4th question would be outside his wheelhouse.\u201d\u201cPlease note that the tone of the show is generally light so even on policy questions, Steve won\u2019t go too deep into details,\u201d the memo said.There was also a pre-package segment of the show that was meant to highlight Clinton\u2019s personal life and her political achievements.\u201cDuring this segment Steve will take a trip down memory lane with YOU to talk about the different moments of YOUR life displayed in the photographs below,\u201d the memo read.From the\u00a0Flint water crisis to\u00a0crime and jobs, Clinton was briefed on topics that would be discussed during her interview.Despite the sit-down being completely choreographed, Clinton\u00a0feigned surprise throughout the interview. \u201cOh boy.

Ultimately, Robertson explains that this is just the latest chapter in a conflict spanning two millennia, described by Augustine of Hippo as the City of Man in opposition to the City of God.Torchbearer\u2014directed by Stephen K. Bannon, produced by Bannon and David Bossie, and written by Bannon, Zach Dasher, and Breitbart News Senior West Coast Editor Rebecca Mansour\u2014gives the viewer a whirlwind tour of world history with a focus on the Christian experience from apostolic times to the present, showcasing the pattern of how godless humanity descends into depravity, in stark contrast to the sublime virtues with which God\u2019s people adorn their lives in the face of adversity\u2014all narrated in the iconic voice of the Duck Commander.Torchbearer\u2019s trailer takes the viewer on a global odyssey from the Areopagus in Athens, to St. Peter\u2019s Square and the Coliseum Rome, to countless rows of white crosses in Normandy, to a jail cell in Birmingham. The full documentary delves deep into each of these venues and more, in a movie that is simultaneously fast-paced yet thought-provoking.\u201cSocial Darwinism. Survival of the fittest.\u201d That is how Robertson summarizes a godless view of human existence, explaining that if there is no higher being to whom man is accountable, the motto becomes, \u201cMight makes right.\u201dRegimes based upon a worldview that rejects God\u2019s authority become violently hostile to those who peacefully live out biblical faith. Ancient Rome was the first example of this after the death and resurrection of Christ, as Christians would not join the new cult of emperor worship. \u201cChristians did not mind praying for the emperor, but they would not pray to the emperor,\u201d Robertson explained.When ordered to offer a small pinch of incense as a sign of worship to the Roman emperor, Christians went willingly to their deaths instead\u2014and were slaughtered en masse.Pivoting to those people, Robertson explains that God is \u201cthe creator of all things. God created man and woman in his image. We are image-bearers of God.\u201dHowever, \u201conce you forget where your rights come from\u2026 oh my goodness,\u201d Robertson sighs. He lays out \u201can indictment of the human race,\u201d quoting from Romans 1:28, \u201cSince they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.\u201dTorchbearer links respect for human rights and a willingness to defend human dignity to faith in God, focusing on the selfless works of service and charity earnestly carried out by countless people of faith.The film also explores the price that countless Christians have paid for their commitment to follow Jesus Christ, beginning with the martyrdom of the apostles Peter and Paul.Stories like these do not merely belong in the past, however, or found solely overseas. Although punishments here have not yet come close to being violent, observant Christians in America are suffering lesser forms of punishment for declining to offer a pinch of incense to the emperor, consequences that are increasing both in frequency and in severity.Just in the past few years:In fact, several of these cases arose just in the past year, and some are still in court today, or are about to go to court. And these are only a fraction of the current struggles going on in America involving observant Christians and people of other faiths.I should know.

Scott was just 17 years old when she was killed in the now-famous shooting attack on the morning of April 20, 1999\u00a0in Littleton, Colorado.A new clip from I\u2019m Not Ashamed provided exclusively to Breitbart News gives viewers the first look at the film\u2019s Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, played by actors David Errigo Jr. and Cory Chapman, respectively.Get rid of all the fat, retarded, crippled, stupid, ignorant, rich, worthless people in this world,\u201d Harris says in the clip, from a scene set in Columbine high school\u2019s cafeteria. \u201cNo one is worthy of this planet. Only me and who I choose. Everyone should be sent out into space, and only the people I say should be left behind.\u201dThe eventual killers then look on as a group of their fellow students is bullied by other students.The film \u2014 directed by Brian Baugh and starring Masey McLain as Scott \u2014 has already stirred controversy online after the filmmakers accused YouTube of anti-Christian bias for pulling the film\u2019s trailer from the video streaming site for months without providing an explanation.According to the Hollywood Reporter, I\u2019m Not Ashamed producer Chuck Howard was told last October that the film\u2019s trailer violated YouTube standards, and the clip was subsequently taken offline and the account behind it suspended.In a letter sent to YouTube, the filmmakers\u2019 attorney Garrick Stotser claimed the removal of the film\u2019s trailer from the site interfered with its marketing campaign, and seeks compensation for the 11 months of lost advertising opportunity. The letter accuses the streaming giant of failing to provide \u201cany clear explanation or substantiation\u201d for why the clip was pulled offline.The trailer was reportedly restored to YouTube only after the company was contacted by the Hollywood Reporter last week.YouTube responded in a statement to THR released Thursday:\u00a0\u201cWith the massive volume of videos on our platform, sometimes we make the wrong call on content that is flagged by our community. When this is brought to our attention, we review the content and take appropriate action, including restoring videos or channels that were mistakenly removed.\u201dI\u2019m Not Ashamed opens in theaters nationwide on October 21.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, anti-Christian bias, Christian Film, faith-based film, I'm Not Ashamed, Masey McLain, Pure Flix, YoutubeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Stiller said that if he hadn\u2019t been receiving a regular test called a PSA test to screen for the deadly cancer, he may never have caught it in time.Stiller followed up his appearance on Howard Stern\u2019s show with an essay posted to Medium about his experience.\u201cI got diagnosed with prostate cancer Friday, June 13th, 2014. On September 17th of that year I got a test back telling me I was cancer free,\u201d Stiller wrote. \u201cThe three months in between were a crazy roller coaster ride with which about 180,000 men a year in America can identify.\u201dHe continued:\u201cTaking the PSA test saved my life. Literally. That\u2019s why I am writing this now. There has been a lot of controversy over the test in the last few years. Articles and op-eds on whether it is safe, studies that seem to be interpreted in many different ways, and debates about whether men should take it all. I am not offering a scientific point of view here, just a personal one, based on my experience. The bottom line for me: I was lucky enough to have a doctor who gave me what they call a \u201cbaseline\u201d PSA test when I was about 46. I have no history of prostate cancer in my family and I am not in the high-risk group, being neither\u200a\u2014\u200ato the best of my knowledge\u200a\u2014\u200aof African or Scandinavian ancestry. I had no symptoms.\u201dThe actor praised the \u201cthoughtful\u201d internist who conducted PSA tests on him, avoiding guidelines set forth by by the American Cancer Society to wait until age 50 to conduct them. The actor wrote that critics of the test contend that,\u00a0\u201cdepending on how they interpret the data, doctors can send patients for further tests like the MRI and the more invasive biopsy, when not needed.\u201d\u201cBut without this PSA test itself, or any screening procedure at all, how are doctors going to detect asymptomatic cases like mine, before the cancer has spread and metastasized throughout one\u2019s body rendering it incurable?\u201d Stiller wrote.Stiller\u00a0concluded by revealing that he has now been cancer-free for two years. The actor and filmmaker has a number of projects coming up, both in front of and behind the camera, including a starring role opposite Adam Sandler and Dustin Hoffman in Noah Baumbach\u2019s next movie and as a producer on Dodgeball 2 and Jack Black comedy The Polka King.\u00a0Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumBig Hollywood, Ben Stiller, Howard Stern, prostate cancer, PSA TestComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

We\u2019ve watched how he does business and we\u2019ve watched him say things and then we\u2019ve seen whether or not he did those things, we have seen how he treats the people he does business with. I would give the same answer that I would have given 10 years ago, when he was just as loathsome.\u201dBourdain\u2019s bitter remarks toward Trump came on the heels of the eighth season premiere of his five-time Emmy Award winning show, which featured none other than President Obama.However, Bourdain rejects\u00a0the idea of featuring politicos on his show and said Obama\u2019s appearance \u201ckind of fell in our lap.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t reach out to the White House,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I\u2019m anxious to do again.

A lot of anti-immigrant sentiment, a lot of fear and undirected anger but I\u2019ve never seen in my lifetime the kind of national conversation that we\u2019re actually having in the open now.\u201d\u201cIt would have been unthinkable at any point in my life, eight years ago, if a candidate for a major party was endorsed by the America Nazi Party and the Aryan Nation it\u2019s something [major figures] would feel obliged to denounce. Now, that apparently isn\u2019t reason enough to say anything.\u201dAsked if he\u2019s detected a change in how people around the world view America, the chef said \u201cI mean, there is a sense of utter disbelief, everywhere I go, at Mr. Trump.\u201d\u201cThat is for sure. I mean, I\u2019m talking among our allies, England, France Germany, Italy,\u201d Bourdain continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing you can find.

I want you to think of me more like a Hollywood movie star, like Leo, who is totally down with the kids and really cool\u201d mode. He took the opportunity to reiterate just how incredibly important an issue climate change is \u2013 as indeed he would, given that if this isn\u2019t the case then he has just gone and blown two whole terms of a US presidency on absolutely nothing.Hayhoe, meanwhile, was there to lend the event the veneer of scientific credibility.She was certainly right on one thing. The bit where she said:\u201cWe are pouring all of our money, all of our effort, all of our prayers into a bucket and the bucket has a hole in the bottom. That hole is climate change.\u201dThis is probably the truest, wisest, cleverest thing any climate alarmist scientist has ever said in history \u2013 even the truth only came out by accident and not in the way she intended.But yes, the whole climate change industry is indeed like pouring trillions of dollars (and hope and effort and prayers, etc) into a bucket with an almighty hole in it.Here, by way of a reminder, is the rough annual cost of the climate change industry \u2013 $1.5 trillion.And here is what the combined decarbonisation efforts of the world\u2019s industrial and developing nations are going to achieve by the end of the century thanks to the vital COP21 summit in Paris last year.A reduction in global temperatures by the end of the century of 0.048 degrees C \u2013 ie around 1/20th of a degree C.If this represents a sensible use of scarce resources, I would love to hear acclaimed climate expert and economist Leonardo DiCaprio explain how.

I\u2019ve never seen that before. There isn\u2019t really a bifurcation.\u201dColbert also defended his late-night rival and Tonight Show\u00a0host Jimmy Fallon, who recently came under fire for what critics charged was a \u201csoftball\u201d\u00a0interview with Trump in September.\u201cEvery host\u2019s responsibility is to be honest with themselves and with their audience about the kind of show that they do.

If we\u2019ve done our jobs properly, they also have more laughs and suspense \u2013 and\u00a0much\u00a0better artwork,\u201d Smith said in a recent interview. \u201cClinton Cash: A Graphic Novel\u00a0is the most subversive foray into pop culture the right has ever attempted and, more importantly, it has been successful.\u00a0So successful and effective in fact that it was recently banned from the shelves of a Florida Public Library.\u201dIndeed, as Breitbart News reported, the\u00a0Alachua County Library District denied\u00a0county\u00a0resident Ann Loot\u2019s\u00a0request to place\u00a0Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel\u00a0on its shelves \u2014 a ban that occurred mere weeks before the start of Banned Books Week.The graphic novel was always meant to convey the fact-based reporting found in\u00a0Clinton Cash\u00a0\u201cin a way that makes it accessible to people who don\u2019t have time to sit down and read a serious nonfiction book,\u201d\u00a0Clinton Cash\u00a0author and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter\u00a0Schweizer\u00a0told\u00a0Fox & Friends\u00a0in a recent interview.\u201cI think millennials love this sort of approach because it\u2019s humorous,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cThey put in humor. It\u2019s a lot of great visual images.\u201dIn an appearance in August on\u00a0Breitbart News Daily\u00a0SiriusXM radio, Smith, reiterating what Schweizer had said, said the book\u2019s form as a\u00a0\u201csubversive\u201d message to young Americans is what initially attracted him to the project.\u201cOne of the things that really attracted me to the project was it gave us an opportunity to do something really subversive \u2013 probably one of the most subversive things the Right has done when it comes to pop culture maybe since\u00a0Clinton Cash, the documentary,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd of course, Andrew [Breitbart] always said that politics is downstream from culture. And I was really interested in seeing if we could make those two intersect. And I think we were able to do that in a crisp, engaging and new way with\u00a0Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel, and we do that through humor, which is also something which I think is new and cutting edge \u2013 definitely avant-garde for the Right \u2013 using satire and humor, parody, mockery.\u201d\u201cThe Right has not lost the culture war. The Right has almost ceded the culture war by not engaging, and I really wanted to use the Left\u2019s weapons back on them,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cIt\u2019s payback time. They don\u2019t own pop culture. They don\u2019t own it all. They don\u2019t own that territory, and we need to start taking it back. Jon Stewart just signed a four-year deal with HBO. He\u2019s got an animation studio geared up. He\u2019s got 3-D graphics cranking.

Neither Kardashian nor Moms Demand noted that the alleged gunman behind the church attack acquired his gun via a background check.On June 12, 2016 \u2014 the very day of the deadly firearm-based attack at a nightclub in Orlando \u2014 Kardashian called for expanding background checks in a way that would prevent persons on the terror watch list from acquiring guns. She tweeted, \u201cUnder current federal law people on terror watch lists can legally buy guns \u2013 this is called the Terror Gap.\u201dUnder current federal law people on terror watch lists can legally buy guns \u2013 this is called the Terror Gap\u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 12, 2016Kardashian did not mention that the Orlando attacker was not on a terror watch list, so adding such a list to background checks would have done nothing to prevent his attack.On August 5, 2016, Kardashian\u2019s gun control advocacy grew, as did her ties to Moms Demand Action. She and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe\u00a0met with family members of gun violence victims at an event organized\u00a0by Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety.\u00a0The Hollywood Gossip\u00a0reported on the event and quoted\u00a0Kim saying, \u201cHaving lunch with the families of loved ones who were killed by gun violence. I learned a lot from listening to their stories.\u201d She added, \u201cLife is so precious! What will it take for this to stop?\u201d She gave a shout-out to \u201cEverytown [for Gun Safety]\u201d and \u201cMoms Demand.\u201dThen came October 2, 2016, in Paris \u2014 in a city with nearly every gun control measure on the Democrats\u2019 wish list \u2014 and the reality TV star\u00a0was held at gunpoint by armed men who reportedly locked her in a bathroom and stole cellphones and jewelry worth around $10 million.

In fact, they\u2019ve been known to stretch the concept quite a bit.In May, Reuters reported that Chinese state-owned business entities have \u201cadopted a controversial defense when they face U.S. lawsuits: You can\u2019t touch us because we enjoy sovereign immunity.\u201dOne of these questionable claims of sovereign immunity was\u00a0made in response to a lawsuit over the infamous \u201cChinese drywall,\u201d defective building materials supplied during the U.S. housing boom that produces damaging chemicals when it degrades, leaving homeowners with thousands of dollars in repairs.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry \u201cargued in a diplomatic note that U.S. courts have no jurisdiction over suits against a country\u2019s \u2018state-owned properties,'\u201d invoking the U.S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976.Another case involved the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which challenged a $70 billion arbitration judgment in federal district court by invoking sovereign immunity as a state-run enterprise.\u201cI think there is a mentality in China that, hey, we are behind these big walls and nobody can touch us,\u201d trade litigator Bill Berry observed.\u201cThe use of sovereign immunity by Chinese state-owned conglomerates is a reflection of how China\u2019s state capitalism and legal regime is increasingly running into conflict with Western regulation and jurisprudence, particularly as the country\u2019s overseas investment rapidly grows,\u201d Reuters cautioned\u00a0in May.It\u2019s easy to see why China would have a keen interest in preserving sovereign immunity since so many of its business interests can invoke protection unavailable to fully independent private-sector corporations in the United States.Economics, National Security, China, JASTA, Saudi Arabia, sovereign immunityComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In November 2015, the Turkish government shot down a Russian fighter jet after the Russians had repeatedly violated Turkish airspace and ignored warnings from Turkish troops. The Russian military is present in Syria as an ally of dictator Bashar al-Assad, whom Erdogan has previously referred to as \u201ca more advanced terrorist than the Islamic State.\u201dReports so far do not indicate that Putin has discussed Syria with his Turkish counterpart. Instead, at remarks at the World Energy Congress, Putin discussed a new gas pipeline.\u00a0\u201cWe look positively at the Turkish Stream project. Our efforts are continuing,\u201d he said, adding a nod acknowledging that Erdogan remained in charge of the country after a failed coup attempt on July 15.\u201cWe are very glad that Turkey is recovering and wish it success,\u201d Putin told the audience. Despite the rift between the two nations over the Russian jet incident, Putin was among the first to reach out to Erdogan following the failure of that coup attempt. As Erdogan blames Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, for plotting the coup, Putin\u2019s overture came at a time when Erdogan\u2019s government was expressing strong dissatisfaction with NATO ally America.While the World Energy Congress will not address the Syrian civil war, Kremlin spokesman\u00a0Dmitry Peskov said the public should expect the bilateral relationship to improve \u201cin all aspects,\u201d which may mean some agreement on how to approach the Syrian situation.\u201cIt is expected that this visit, which comes as a follow-up to the two leaders\u2019 earlier meetings in St. Petersburg on Aug. 9 and in Hangzhou [China] on Sept. 3 on the sidelines of the G20, will contribute to further improving our cooperation and to accelerating normalization process between Turkey and Russia,\u201d the Turkish government had previously said of the meeting.As Putin arrived,\u00a0Turkish Prime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said Monday that Turkey and Russia now have \u201cthe same point of view\u201d on Syria, without elaborating.Russia initially entered the Syrian civil war to defend Assad, nominally from the Islamic State. But statistics regarding airstrike locations since Russia began bombing Syria show that they have largely been targeting non-Islamic State anti-Assad opposition. Russia is currently engaged in an extensive bombing campaign targeting civilians in Aleppo, where there is no significantly Islamic State presence.The UN Security Council attempted to pass a resolution against the bombing of civilians in Aleppo, but as Russia currently holds the presidency of that international body, the resolution was vetoed. Russia claims the resolution would have helped unspecified \u201cterrorists.\u201dTo enhance operations in Syria, Russia announced the establishment of a permanent airbase in that country.How Erdogan\u2019s longtime opposition to Assad \u2014 and calls for a no-fly zone over contested regions, which would significantly deter Russian military operations \u2014 will be squared with a desire to invite Russian business into Turkey remains to be seen, though Erdogan has expressed some flexibility on Assad. In August, Erdogan expressed a willingness to allow Assad to participate in peace talks, something that he had adamantly objected to for years.Middle East, National Security, America, Columbus Day, Egypt, Middle East, MuslimsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

(USA Today more specifically states it will be 28 miles southeast of the existing city.)A name has not yet been chosen for the new city, although Egyptian-born U.C.-Berkeley professor Nezar al-Sayyad\u2019s suggestion to call it \u201cSisi-land\u201d after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was not taken well. On a visit to Cairo last year, al-Sayyad\u00a0found himself explaining his satirical jab at the Sisi government\u2019s \u201ctop-down thinking\u201d to some un-amused security officers.Critics seem accordingly nervous about labeling the new capital city a boondoggle, or a feat of bureaucratic vanity, or a cruel diversion of much-needed resources away from crumbling Cairo, and they\u2019re\u00a0especially reluctant to discuss\u00a0the political advantage of moving the seat of government away from the protest-ready throngs of Cairo poor. Some in the government are not comforted by the sight of Tahrir Square, site of the \u201cArab Spring\u201d uprising, looming outside their office windows.Roads and bridges are under construction now, with Phase I of the project, and the first permanent residents of the new city, scheduled for completion within five years.Unfortunately for Egyptian planners, the population of Cairo doesn\u2019t seem interested in relocating (or, more poignantly, can\u2019t afford to relocate even if they want to.)Cairo University poli-sci professor Zeyad Elkelani told USA Today that government employment is often inter-generational in Egypt, with government workers passing conveniently-located Cairo apartments down through the generations \u2014 a tradition it sounds like the Egyptian government wants to begin gently discouraging, as it currently has about 7 million public workers on its payroll.\u201cThe new capital is an important step to make room for the private sector.\u00a0The bureaucracy has been choking business in Egypt and the residents of Cairo,\u201d Elkelani said bluntly, expressing hope for a \u201cwelcome attrition in government employment.\u201dProjects to create suburbs and satellite cities around the current Egyptian capital have produced largely unoccupied \u201cghost towns.\u201d The high-tech modernist style of these constructions is said to be unappealing to much of the Egyptian populace, which is bad news for the new Chinese-engineered capital city, whose mock-ups resemble\u00a0the futuristic dome city from \u201cLogan\u2019s Run.\u201dTo overcome such resistance, the Egyptian government is already announcing plans to shut down at least one major government building in Cairo, workplace for some 30,000 public employees, and convert it into a hotel by July 2017.In addition to the massive Chinese investment, companies from other countries, such as India and Saudi Arabia, have expressed interest in building projects. (The Saudi project is described as a \u201c12.6 hectare mosque and Islamic museum\u201d by CNN.)

Santos and FARC terrorist leader \u201cTimochenko\u201d signed the agreement \u2014 which would have let most of the terrorists avoid prison time and run for office, establishing a political party likely to be funded with cocaine profits \u2014 before Colombia narrowly voted it down in a national plebiscite vote.The Nobel committee acknowledged Santos\u2019s efforts without praising the terrorist group, something which leftist elements have suggested was unfair to the terrorist group, responsible for at least 220,000 deaths and another 100,000 disappearances in their history.Maduro implied that he would nominate some of the FARC leadership to the Ch\u00e1vez Peace Prize.Ch\u00e1vez enjoyed a close relationship with the FARC, allowing them to operate\u00a0openly in Venezuela. Before Colombia voted \u201cno\u201d on the peace deal, anti-socialist Venezuelan opposition members publicly expressed concern that many FARC terrorists would move into Venezuela after being cleared of terrorist activity as part of the peace deal, adding to the already long list of political woes the Caribbean nation is currently facing.In addition to Maduro\u2019s ties to the FARC, he has long had a contentious relationship with Santos himself. After violently deporting\u00a0thousands of Colombian nationals, alleging that all Colombians were \u201cparamilitary\u201d members, Santos accused Maduro of using \u201cNazi ghetto tactics\u201d\u00a0against his countrymen which grossly violated international human rights norms.The \u201cHugo Ch\u00e1vez Peace Prize\u201d is reminiscent of China\u2019s \u201cConfucius Peace Prize,\u201d an award created as a response to the issuing of a Nobel to anti-communist Chinese dissidents.\u00a0\u201cI would like to say to those at the Nobel committee, they are orchestrating an anti-China farce by themselves. We are not changing because of interference by a few clowns and we will not change our path,\u201d a Chinese official said in 2010.Four years later, China granted the \u201cConfucius Peace Prize\u201d to mass murderer Fidel Castro.

Xenakis10 Oct 20160This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nIrreecha festive on 2-October, prior to the deadly stampede (Reuters)The declaration of a six-month state of emergency is a major development, as Ethiopia has not declared a state of emergency for decades. However, the government has been increasingly rattled by growing anti-government protests, especially among the marginalized Oromo ethnic group, which comprises 34% of Ethiopia\u2019s population, and among the Amhara ethnic group, which comprises another 27%.The government is largely controlled by the ethnic Tigrays, who are a market and government dominant minority, comprising only 6% of the population. They are extremely authoritarian and have succeeded in marginalizing the other ethnic groups, and are said to have informants in villages throughout the country.According to Ethiopian officials:The Council of Ministers has declared a state of emergency that will be effective as of Sunday evening so as to deal with anti-peace elements that have allied with foreign forces and are jeopardizing the peace and security of the country\u2026The state of emergency was declared following a thorough discussion by the Council of Ministers on the loss of lives and property damages occurring in the country.We put our citizens\u2019 safety first. Besides, we want to put an end to the damage that is being carried out against infrastructure projects, education institutions, health centers, administration and justice buildings.A state of emergency has been declared because the situation posed a threat against the people of the country.The emergency will not breach basic human rights enshrined under the Ethiopian constitution and won\u2019t also effect diplomatic rights listed under the Vienna Convention.The state of emergency will help restore peace and security shortly. It is also intended to smooth the progress of the efforts being made to resolve the problem peacefully.The Ethiopian government is extremely authoritarian, and has always successfully met peaceful protests with arrests and violence. The government has not yet announced details of what the state of emergency will mean, but it is expected that the military will become even more in control, and may become even more violent. Fana Broadcasting (Ethiopia) and Deutsche WelleThe government considered the state of emergency to be necessary following violence at a peaceful protest last week. Dozens to hundreds of ethnic Oromo people were killed last Sunday (2-Oct) when security officials used teargas and gunshots to disperse protesters at the Oromos\u2019 annual Irreecha thanksgiving celebration in the town of Bishoftu. These actions triggered a stampede among the tens of thousands of people peacefully protesting against the government, resulting in the deaths.The Oromos are the largest ethnic group in east Africa, and make up 34% of Ethiopia\u2019s population, where they are split approximately evenly between Christianity and Islam.Most of them live in the Oromia region, which surrounds the capital city Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa is a major metropolis, and it has been growing and expanding. Last year, the government announced a plan to expand Addis Ababa into Oromo farmland, which triggered large scale protests. Massive protests in December 2015 caused the government to back down on the plan, but the protests have continued, because of deep poverty among the Oromos and what they see as marginalization.In recent weeks, the protesters have become violent, and they attacked businesses, putting at risk the government-portrayed image that Ethiopia is the best place in Africa for business investments. This has caused the government to appear desperate to restore stability, so as not to scare away the foreign investors. AFP and BBC and IRIN News and African ArgumentsThe kebeles are the smallest unit of local government in Ethiopia, and exist throughout the entire country, in both rural and urban districts. When the USSR-dominated communist government, known as the Derg dictatorship, was in charge prior to 1991, they were used by the government to exert local control.As I described recently in the  Generational history of Ethiopia and Eritrea, Ethiopia\u2019s last generational crisis war occurred in 1991, when the Derg dictatorship was overthrown. The new constitution promised human rights for everyone. Theoretically, the kebeles were then to become a democrat way of devolving central government power to the local authorities.An election in May 2005 threatened the power of the government dominant ethnic Tigrays, which are only 6% of the population. The kebeles became a powerful instrument for retaining power, according to Human Rights Watch in 2005:While originally intended to help implement the Derg\u2019s ambitious rural development agenda and land reform program, the kebele system quickly evolved into a highly effective mechanism of control and repression. Kebele officials were expected to keep their communities under perpetual surveillance and to report any subversive activities to higher authorities. The kebeles were also used to disseminate government propaganda, implement government policies and maintain general order and discipline. When the EPRDF came to power it retained the kebele as the smallest unit of local government throughout Ethiopia and has continued to use the system to consolidate and extend the power of the ruling party.In Oromia\u2019s rural areas, kebele officials wield a great deal of power over the populations they govern. Most of the region\u2019s rural population consists of subsistence farmers who depend upon kebele officials to provide them with a range of essential services and agricultural inputs. Perhaps most significantly, kebele officials distribute fertilizer to farmers throughout Oromia on credit and are responsible for collecting those debts when they come due. Farmers must also obtain letters from kebele officials verifying their identity and place of residence when they wish to access government services outside of their communities. Such letters are usually required, for example, in order to visit a doctor or send one\u2019s children to secondary school in town.Ethiopia is now in a generational Awakening era, and as I\u2019ve described in Syria, Burundi, and other countries, these are times when anti-government protests only grow, and if the government is sufficiently paranoid, then these peaceful protests are met with increasing violence by government security forces. These protests are only going to increase, possibly sending Ethiopia into an increasing spiral of government violence.Addis Standard (Addis Ababa, 9-Jun-2016) and Human Rights Watch (2005)Related Articles\nIvanka Trump\u2019s shoes will be manufactured in EthiopiaThe Huajian Group, a major Chinese shoe manufacturer, and the manufacturer of Ivanka Trump\u2019s shoes, is considering moving part of its manufacturing business from China to Ethiopia, to take advantage of workers who are paid lower wages.This is not as fatuous a story as it appears to be.

In broad comparison with the wider Federal Government, the federal workforce dedicated to our national security and foreign policy is \u2013 on average \u2013 less diverse, including at the highest levels.While the administration said the lack of diversity does not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunities, the memo highlights actions that will facilitate the inclusion of a more diverse federal workforce.In a blog post that accompanied Obama\u2019s memorandum, national security adviser Susan Rice, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, Secretary of State John Kerry, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and\u00a0USAID Administrator Gayle Smith highlighted the need for the U.S. national security workforce to draw from the strength of America\u2019s diversity.\u201cNearly 40 percent of the approximately 320 million people in the United States are minorities, and an increasing number of them are earning college and graduate degrees,\u201d blogged Rice. \u201cAs America becomes more diverse, so do our best people. Yet, minorities make up less than 20 percent of our senior diplomats and 15 percent of senior military officers and senior intelligence officials.\u201dWhile President Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president, attempted to make diversity a trademark of his tenure, black Americans and Hispanics experienced high unemployment rates during his presidency.Big Government, National Security, Obama, diversity, federal workforce, Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce, White HouseComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Williams, Ph.D.9 Oct 20160In all, the Pope named 17 new cardinals, including 13 who are under 80 years old and therefore eligible to participate in the conclave electing the next pope.Notably, in his selection for cardinals from among the United States bishops, Francis named the recently appointed archbishop of Chicago, Blaise Cupich, a man with impeccable liberal credentials. He also broke with protocol by choosing Archbishop William Tobin of Indianapolis, a relatively small archdiocese never before considered important enough to have a cardinal at its helm.On the other hand, the Pope passed over the conservative archbishops of Philadelphia, Detroit and Los Angeles\u2014Charles Chaput, Allen Vigneron and Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez, respectively\u2014despite the fact that their three important archdioceses have in recent memory always been considered \u201ccardinalatial sees.\u201dArchbishop Chaput was responsible for bringing Pope Francis to the United States in September 2015, hosting the pontiff for the World Meeting of Families.Veteran Vatican analyst John Allen noted that with his new appointments, Pope Francis had engineered a \u201cseismic shift\u201d in the Catholic hierarchy in the United States, and by naming just progressives, \u201cFrancis was making a statement about the direction in which he wants the American church to go.\u201dThe Pope\u2019s picks also underscore the very real divisions within the U.S. Catholic bishops conference.A year ago, Archbishops Cupich and Chaput faced off over a theologically indefensible op-ed published by the Chicago Archbishop that suggested that abortion was no more important than a number of other social justice issues such as unemployment, immigration and capital punishment.In a signed\u00a0essay\u00a0in the Chicago Tribune, Archbishop Cupich listed a series of social ills that he said people should find \u201cjust as appalling\u201d as the gruesome ripping apart of unborn children and the sale of their organs by Planned Parenthood.While applauding the strong reaction to the Planned Parenthood videos, Cupich immediately added: \u201cWe should be no less appalled by the indifference toward the thousands of people who die daily for lack of decent medical care; who are denied rights by a broken immigration system and by racism; who suffer in hunger, joblessness and want; who pay the price of violence in gun-saturated neighborhoods; or who are executed by the state in the name of justice.\u201dA week later, Archbishop Chaput responded with a sharp rebuke to Cupich in his own diocesan newspaper, Catholic Philly. In his article, bearing the pithy title \u201cThere is no equivalence,\u201d Chaput stated: \u201cThe deliberate killing of innocent life is a uniquely wicked act. No amount of contextualizing or deflecting our attention to other issues can obscure that.\u201dThis was not the first time that Archbishop Cupich has \u201ccontextualized\u201d the evil of abortion.A regular contributor to the Jesuit magazine\u00a0America, in 2008, Cupich wrote a piece against\u00a0racism,\u00a0just prior to the presidential election that saw Barack Obama elected president. In it, he suggested that voting on the basis of race is morally equivalent to voting for a pro-abortion candidate.For his part, Indianapolis Archbishop William Tobin has also been critical of America\u2019s culture wars, and publicly clashed with Republic vice presidential nominee Mike Pence over the idea of welcoming Syrian refugees into the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.Sunday\u2019s nominations represent an important step in Francis\u2019s project of shifting emphases within Church, as well as his move toward more global representation among the college of cardinals. The bulk of the new cardinals come from outside Europe, hailing from Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania.The sole Italian elector the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to Syria, Archbishop Mario Zenari.The ceremony for the creation of the new cardinals will be held on November 19, at the conclusion of the Jubilee Year of Mercy.Follow Thomas D.

Security Council (UNSC), considered the most powerful body of the alliance, decided to ignore the growing tensions between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.The decision comes after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed deep concerns over the significant increase in tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of recent developments in Kashmir, particularly military clashes between the two countries along the border that separates their respective Kashmir regions in violation of the 2003 ceasefire.\u201cHe calls on the Governments of Pakistan and India to address their outstanding issues, including regarding Kashmir, peacefully through diplomacy and dialogue. His good offices are available, if accepted by both sides,\u201d said a spokesman for Ban in a statement issued Sept. 30.That same day, Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan\u2019s UN ambassador, pleaded with U.N. secretary-general \u00a0to intervene in what she referred to as a \u201cdangerous\u201d situation between the two nuclear-armed rivals.\u201cThis is a dangerous moment for the region,\u201d Lodhi said after meeting with Ban at UN headquarters in New York. \u201cThe time has come for bold intervention by him if we are to avoid a crisis, because we can see a crisis building up.\u201dThe U.N. chief has reportedly offered to mediate efforts to defuse escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.On Tuesday, day after the Russian-led U.N. Security Council said it was planning to address the India-Pakistan confrontations over Kashmir, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said the commissioner, \u201cis seriously concerned about the human rights situation in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, as well as the rising tensions between India and Pakistan.\u201dIn public, India and Pakistan have expressed a willingness to defuse the rising tensions. However, both countries accuse one another of provocations that have led to ceasefire violations. They both appear to have preconditions for peace.While India has long accused Pakistan for providing military assistance and training to rebels and even some terrorists fighting in Kashmir for independence from India or to merge the region with Pakistan, Islamabad has accused India of cracking down on dissent among the Muslim-majority population of Kashmir seeking independence from India or a merger with Pakistan.About a year ago, Islamabad also accused India of backing terrorist groups, namely the Pakistani Taliban known as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, reported The Hindu.Meanwhile, India has accused Pakistan of backing terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).New Delhi blames Islamabad for helping LeT foment unrest in Kashmir.Big Government, Jihad, National Security, India, Kashmir, Lashkar-e-Taiba, LeT, Pakistan, Pakistani Taliban, Russia, Tehrik-e-Taliban, TTP, United Nations, united statesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Any movement or intervention by Turkish forces during the military operations [to re-take Mosul] would be faced with a very strong response,\u201d he stated.Ankara has expressed an enthusiastic desire to participate in the liberations of both Mosul and Raqqa, Syria, the \u201ccapitals\u201d of the Islamic State in either country.\u00a0\u201cWe are ready to give all kinds of support in the fight against Daesh [ISIS] in Mosul,\u201d\u00a0Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said on Friday, referring to the troops currently stationed in Iraq, against the wishes of the Iraqi government.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in turn, has said that \u201cObama particularly wants to do something together [with us] about Raqqa.\u00a0We have told him that this is not a problem for us.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, we have to show that we exist in the region. We do not have an option to step back at this point,\u201d Erdogan added, in statements last month.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said earlier this week that Turkey\u2019s presence could spark a \u201cregional war\u201d in Iraq, and the Foreign Minister referred to Turkish troops as a \u201chostile occupying force.\u201d Both nations summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors over the incident. Middle East Eye quotes\u00a0Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus dismissing Iraqi protests, arguing,\u00a0\u201cNo one has the right to object Turkey\u2019s presence in Iraq when the country is fragmented that much.\u201dIraq is currently divided among the Shiite government in Baghdad; the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in the north; the Islamic State in Mosul; and a variety of both Sunni and Shiite roving jihadist militias.The Shiite militias also told Middle East Eye that they will attack Turkish troops, with one leader saying, \u201cwe consider them an occupation force and we will deal with them on this basis.\u201dPrime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has called the Iraqi government\u2019s opposition to the Turkish presence in the country \u201cdangerous and provocative.\u201dTurkey insists its troops are in Iraq at the behest of the KRG in Erbil. \u201cIt is clear from the very beginning that the [President\u00a0Massoud]\u00a0Barzani administration\u00a0wanted the support of Turkish forces to train local forces to liberate Mosul,\u201d Turkish government spokesman Numan Kurtulmus said earlier this month. \u201cWe will not allow this to be a matter of debate.\u201d Al Monitor notes that the KRG has neither denied this nor enthusiastically embraced a Turkish presence in the region, stating only that they were aware of the troop deployment and did not object.While Turkey is currently embroiled in a conflict with the Syrian Kurdish militias, which it claims are a wing of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) terrorist group, it has enjoyed friendly relations with the Iraqi Kurdish government. Turkey fears that Syrian Kurdish groups will attempt to establish a sovereign Kurdistan using Turkish territory; a sovereign Kurdistan in modern-day Iraq would, on the other hand, not threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. The KRG has long opposed the PKK and requested it evacuate Iraq.The United Nations has weighed in on the conflict on behalf of Iraq. The Security Council \u2013 now led by Russia, an ally of Iran and Syria, the regional Shiite governments \u2013 issued a statement demanding Turkey respect \u201cthe principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference.\u201dTurkish-Russian diplomacy collapsed last year after the Russians repeatedly violated Turkey\u2019s territorial integrity, flying fighter jets meant to be targeting ISIS deep into Turkish airspace.Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have attempted to restore the bilateral relationship, however, and Putin will be traveling to Ankara on October 10.Middle East, National Security, Bashar al-Assad, Iran, Iraq, Islamic State, Mosul, Raqqa, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Shia militias, TurkeyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Xenakis9 Oct 20160This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nKashmiri Muslim women shout anti-India slogans in Srinagar on Saturday (EPA)Junaid Ahmad Akhoon, a 12-year-old boy, died early on Saturday after being \u201csprayed with pellets\u201d by police pellet guns on Friday during anti-India protests. About 50 more people were injured during the Friday protests. Police said the boy was injured during clashes between protesters and security forces, but the local residents alleged that the boy was not involved in any protest.The killing triggered new violent clashes on Saturday between thousands of protesters in Srinagar, the provincial capital city of Kashmir, and Indian troops, who fired warning shots and used tear gas and pellet guns. Intermittent clashes spread to different regions in Kashmir throughout the day. Curfews were re-imposed in several districts, after having been lifted for only a few days.It is now been 92 days of almost continuous protests and riots since the July 8 killing by security forces of Burhan Wani, the leader of the Hizbul Mujahideen separatist group in Kashmir. Over 90 people have been killed and over 12,000 injured since the July 8 killing. Stone-throwing crowds are met with security forces spraying the crowds using pellet guns. Hundreds of people have been blinded by the pellets. International Business Times and Daily Kashmir ImagesRelated ArticlesAccording to official government figures, 446 people were arrested in the last week. Close to 7000 people have been arrested in Jammu and Kashmir since July 8, while more than 450 people have been booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA), a 1978 law considered highly restrictive. In addition, police sources say that 1500 others are under detention without any charges, and their detention doesn\u2019t reflect in the official records.Judging from Indian media, numbers like these are driving increased acceptance of the view that the continuing protests and violence in Kashmir are not being caused by Pakistan, but are \u201cindigenous\u201d and \u201corganic,\u201d meaning that it\u2019s coming from the people, rather than from the politicians.One Kashmir government spokesman, Nayeem Akhtar, compared the situation today to protests that occurred in 2010, which were purely political:[We are finding] ourselves in an unprecedented situation. \u2026There is a difference, lot of difference between 2010 and 2016. Like the local leadership apparently is not in control, the leadership has gone to 10 and 12 year old boys. Those who lead are driven by the street. In 2010, they could assert and bring it back. What we did (in 2010) is the role of opposition. I wish National Conference does the same but they have disappeared.\u201cNational Conference\u201d is a political party formed in 1947 with the objective of achieving Kashmiri independence from India through political means. Akhtar\u2019s point is that there is no longer political control of the protests, which are now being led by teenagers who weren\u2019t even around to protest in the past. It\u2019s this generational change that\u2019s caused a political protest to become a violent protest.Parvez Imroz, a rights activist in Kashmir supporting the separatists, also emphasizes a generational change:The government doesn\u2019t really know what to do and how to control protests.The state has become more vehement, firing bullets and pellets on unarmed people. But, despite all this use of force, people are organizing these protests well, which was not the case in the early 1990s. It was more of an emotional outburst back then. And many young people who are now on the streets have not seen the fear and terror that was instilled by the government forces in early 1990s.Now that element of fear is gone. \u2026The use of force against protesters is likely to continue. But one thing is certain \u2013 this uprising has given [a] new dimension to the resistance in Kashmir.The young generation is really controlling things on the streets.In [the] 1990s, and even till early 2000, some people from here would go and openly talk to the Indian government on behalf of people, but that can\u2019t happen now because people here have realized nothing comes out of these talks.But it remains to be seen how young people leading the protests will organize themselves and lead the struggle in the times ahead.From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this is how the world works. The 1947 Partition war between Muslims and Hindus was one of the bloodiest wars of the 20th century, so horrific that the survivors did everything they could to make sure that it never happens again. And the survivors were successful, as long as they were alive. But now they\u2019re pretty much all gone, and the young people rioting in Kashmir have no personal connection to the horrors of the Partition war, and they\u2019re ready, willing, anxious and able to risk having it happen again.As I  described in a recent article, India\u2019s last two generational crisis wars were India\u2019s 1857 Rebellion, which pitted India\u2019s Hindus against the British colonialists, and the 1947 Partition war, which pitted Hindus and Muslims against each other, following the partitioning of the Indian subcontinent into India and Pakistan. As we described in that article, the 1857 war led naturally to violence between Hindus and Muslims decades later, and then to the 1947 war.Now we\u2019re seeing that the 1947 war is leading, decades later, to new violence between Hindus and Muslims. Generational Dynamics predicts that we\u2019re seeing a kind of repeat of 1947, and that this increasing violence will lead to a new generational crisis war between Hindus and Muslims, and from there to full-scale war between Pakistan and India.

The company will redeploy some assets from its DHL Express operations to establish a parcels network in the two countries next year, she said.She said similar initiatives using existing assets would take precedence over big acquisitions.\u201cWe feel the house is the way we want it to be,\u201d she said, adding that further deals would add \u201ca nice piece of furniture\u201d.The growing popularity of internet shopping was driving demand for its parcels services, she said.In Germany, where it had 44 percent of the market in 2015, the group is expecting a record Christmas. \u201cWe have on average 4 million parcels a day (\u2026) we expect in the pre-Christmas peak to go up to 8 million parcels,\u201d she said.BREXIT OPPORTUNITYKreis said she was personally sad about Brexit, but the group had traded through many political and financial upheavals in the more than 220 countries where it operates and it would take Brexit in its stride.\u201cThe big noticeable thing at this point is the devaluation in the pound, but in terms of real underlying trading we don\u2019t see any deterioration in growth rates,\u201d she said.Brexit could be an opportunity, she said.\u201cWe are also very experienced in dealing with situations where there are trade regulations and complex customs regimes, that to a certain degree is something we sell to our customers,\u201d she said. \u201cComplex customs regulations are something where you as a logistics company can show your strength.\u201dIn terms of Deutsche Post\u2019s financial strategy, Kreis said the message was one of continuity.She wants to maintain the group\u2019s triple B plus credit rating, keep to its guidance of paying 40-60 percent of net profit as dividends, and redistribute excess liquidity to shareholders or use it to fund pensions.After a year beset by strikes, the company, which provides one in 200 German jobs, is rebuilding its profits.

Four civilians were killed by gunfire from an armored police vehicle in the town of Yuksekova near the Iranian border.On Thursday, a bomb attack near a police station in Istanbul wounded 10 people. The Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK), a PKK offshoot, claimed responsibility for that blast.The PKK, which launched a separatist insurgency in 1984, is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.A two-year ceasefire between the group and Turkish authorities collapsed in July last year and the violence subsequently rose to levels not seen since the height of the conflict in the 1990s.The surge in violence coincides with a Turkish military operation in northern Syria in support of rebels and designed to drive away from the border Islamic State militants and a Syrian Kurdish militia closely linked to the PKK.President Tayyip Erdogan chaired a security summit with the head of the armed forces and ministers in Istanbul on Saturday, but details of the meeting have not been disclosed.Breitbart Jerusalem, Middle East, National Security, Abdullah Ocalan, car bomb, Islamic State, Kurdistan Freedom Hawks, Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, President Tayyip Erdogan, Syrian Kurdish militia, Turkish militantsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Three\u00a0other civilians were moderately wounded and a further two sustained light injuries.Police cordoned off the area and, according to civilian reports, set up road blocks in the area to search for additional suspects.Abu Sabih is an Arab with Israeli citizenship from\u00a0the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan.The Jerusalem Light Rail, which had a station near the scene of the attack, temporarily suspended all services.Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said the attack was \u201ca natural reaction to the continued crimes of the occupation against Palestinians and the al-Aqsa Mosque.\u201dThe Gaza-based terror group has not claimed responsibility for the attack.Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart TV, National Security, Ammunition Hill, Gaza, Gaza Strip, Hamas terrorists, Israel security, Israel-Arab conflict, Jerusalem, Palestinian Terrorism, Palestinian terrorists, shooting attack, TerroristsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The total number of olim for the entirety of 2015 was 7,835.JPPI mentioned several factors for the dramatic decline, among them the French authorities\u2019 commitment to battle anti-Semitism, the fact that most of the Zionist Jews in France have already made aliyah, and the rise of terrorist activity in Israel which has weakened its comparative appeal with French Jewry.Read more here.Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart London, National Security, aliyah, anti-semitism, French immigration, Israel security, Jewish Agency for Israel, Jewish Diaspora, Jewish faith, Judaism, olim, Zionist Jews in FranceComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Medical staff were initially able to resuscitate the 15 year old, and took her to hospital, but she died yesterday of what toxicology reports indicate was a cocaine overdose.Shortly after the girl was discovered in Innsbruck, police brought a Syrian man in for questioning in relation to the case. The 22 year old told officials that he and a friend had watched through a window and seen two Moroccan men moving the girl to the stairwell.In subsequent interrogations, police found the Syrian\u2019s story to be full of contradictions and a second Syrian national was questioned. Eventually, they had to admit the girl had consumed drugs and alcohol in their apartment.The two men had moved the girl outside when she lost consciousness as they were afraid they would get in trouble with the police, the Tiroler Tageszeitung reported.The two men, both of whom have been granted asylum, are blaming one another for the girl\u2019s death. \u201cThey accuse each other. One Syrian says that the other gave the girl the cocaine and vice versa\u201d, an investigator working on the case told Kronen Zeitung.According to the spokesman for the Innsbruck prosecutor, Hansj\u00f6rg Mayr, the men are suspected of giving narcotic drugs to a minor and of failure to assist a wounded person.

Xenakis8 Oct 20160This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nRussian trolls \u2013 Bruce Plante (Tulsa World, 11-Jun-2015)There have been a number of questions and comments about my recent articles on Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria.TheLastPlainsman: \u201cIt appears, Mr. Xenakis, that you are still the target of Soviet, err, I mean, Russian, trolls. At least there aren\u2019t any China ones. Today, anyway.\u201dYes, Russia has hired hundreds of trolls to harass people like me. At one point last year, I was being attacked and harassed by three Russian trolls at the same time.In a sense, the whole policy has backfired. Every journalist by now has become aware that they\u2019ll be attacked by Russian trolls if they write anything critical of Russia. So the result is that any person who actually believes what he\u2019s saying in defense of Bashar al-Assad or Vladimir Putin is automatically assumed to be a paid Russian troll. The Russians brought this on themselves.Mickey Wasp: \u201cIt is clear from this completely fraudulent article he has penned that Mr. X is not above composing lies in order to further the nefarious agenda of the Zionist criminal enterprise known as Israel and Warmongers of Congress and the CIA.Anyone who can write a line such as \u201cAfter years promising to help end the violence in Syria, Russian and Syrian warplanes have been indiscriminately attacking civilian neighborhoods and hospitals with barrel bombs, chemical weapons (chlorine gas), phosphorous bombs, cluster bombs and bunker bombs. It does not take rocket science to see that Russia and Syria have no intention of ending the violence.\u201d is not fit to call themselves a journalist or researcher or columnist, instead they should be labelled as a disgusting black propagandist and seen as working for those who created the conflict in Syria.\u201dAll of these things that I listed \u2014 attacking civilian neighborhoods and hospitals with barrel bombs, chemical weapons (chlorine gas), phosphorous bombs, cluster bombs and bunker bombs \u2014 have been widely reported in mainstream media and by government organizations in America, Europe, the Mideast and the United Nations. The only people saying that it\u2019s all made up are Russian and Syrian officials, as well as the army of paid Russian trolls.Related ArticlesScotster brightmoth: \u201cAmid the demonization of the Syrian government and leadership and the skillful use of social media by anti-government activists. Influenced by both mainstream and this alternative media, most people in the West do not know that Bashar al-Assad remains popular with many Syrians. Nor do they realize that Assad won an election two years ago.\u201dWhat the heck does that have to do with anything? Bashar al-Assad is being charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. What does it matter whether he won an election? Adolf Hitler won elections. Mao Zedong, Pol Pot and Josef Stalin were all very popular.There\u2019s a very important point here. It\u2019s the popularity of genocidal leaders that makes the genocidal acts possible. An unpopular leader could never get away with trying to exterminate an entire religious or ethnic group, as Bashar al-Assad is trying to exterminate the Sunni Muslims. A genocidal leader has to be popular to get away with his depraved acts. So when you talk about al-Assad\u2019s popularity, my response is that of course he\u2019s popular, and has to be to get away with committing genocide.Related ArticlesMickey Wasp: \u201cWe are experiencing the same demonization of Syria\u2019s al-Assad and Russia\u2019s Putin that we witnessed before those other two wars on Saddam and Gaddafi. Every possible allegation is made against them, often based on dubious and deceitful \u201cevidence,\u201d but it goes unchallenged because to question the propaganda opens a person to charges of being an \u201capologist\u201d or \u201cstooge\u201d or if they post on Xenakis articles, a Russia troll.\u201dIf it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck. You claim that you\u2019re a Texas redneck, but you quack like a Russian troll.There was a good example this last week of how Russian trolls work. A Dutch-led team announced the findings of a major investigation proving that Russians in eastern Ukraine in July 2014 shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 passenger plane with a Russian Buk 9M38 missile that was transported by a Volvo truck from Russia, and then transported back to Russia after it had been used to shoot down the plane.There are literally thousands of pieces of evidence, including intercepted phone calls, photos, analyzed and authenticated, videos, forensic examinations, witness statements, satellite images, and radar data. The amount of evidence is overwhelming.But the Russian trolls have been out in force saying that all the photos are photoshopped, and all the evidence was faked. And The Washington Post reports that numerous reporters have been targeted by Russian government hackers. I\u2019ve been targeted many times by both Russian and Chinese hackers. That\u2019s the game these Russian trolls play.So when this Russian troll says that \u201cevery possible allegation is made against [al-Assad and Putin], often based on dubious and deceitful \u2018evidence,'\u201d he\u2019s just being a good troll and saying the same things over and over despite overwhelming evidence. He should get an extra pay bonus from his trollmaster for being such a good troll.Here is another point worth making. I believe the truth of everything that I write. I have written about 4,000 articles on my web site since 2003, and every word is based on extensive research and reporting. I have an archive of some 85,000 articles that I have copied and pasted, and I add a dozen or so articles to the archive every day. I have to be sure of every fact, because if I make a mistake, then I know that people will pound on me for it.But that is not true of the Russian trolls. They know very well that Russians shot down the MH17 plane. They know very well that Bashar al-Assad is committing genocide. They know very well that Vladimir Putin is guilty of war crimes. But they\u2019re paid to lie, and they sell their souls every day to defend the greatest genocidal monsters of the 21st century so far.Guardian (London) and Washington PostRelated ArticlesJasmine16: \u201cPresident Assad wants to kill all Sunni Muslims? Come on. His wife is a Sunni. Many of his ministers and military officers are Sunnis. Many of his armed force officers are Sunnis. The majority of Syrian population prefer to live in government controlled areas. Even CIA and Qatar study reveal that 70% of Syrians-most of whom are (moderate) Sunnis, support him, while 20% are neutral, and only 10 % are against him. How on earth could the writer claims that the president wants \u201d \u2026 to massacre \u2026 all Sunni Muslim civilians \u2026.\u201d?\u201dThere is an extremely bloody historic fault line between Shia/Alawites (like Bashar al-Assad) and Sunnis. It is pretty clear that al-Assad wants to kill a large segment of Syria\u2019s civilian population, possibly millions of people, on the other side of that historic fault line, but there\u2019s a problem of how to characterize those people \u2014 what name should we give that group? Al-Assad just calls them all \u201cterrorists,\u201d but obviously children in a school or women and children in a marketplace slaughtered by an al-Assad airstrike are not \u201cterrorists\u201d in any meaningful sense. So in view of the historic hatred between Alawites and Sunnis, I use the characterization \u201cSunni Muslims\u201d as the most convenient way to describe the portion of the population that al-Assad wants to exterminate. It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s some kind of ethnic descriptor that could be used to make the characterization more precise, but I\u2019m not aware of one.TheLastConservative: \u201c\u2018In other words, it\u2019s just more bizarre garbage coming out of the mouths of Russian officials.\u2019 Which is a lot like #*&$ coming out of the State Department isn\u2019t it? There are no good guys in this situation. We are obviously too incompetent and should get out of it. We\u2019ve messed up enough as it is.\u201dA lot of people feel that way. But a lot more people feel that America has a moral obligation to be policeman of the world, so it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll get out of the situation.TheLastPlainsman: \u201cSo now that confuses me- what is your prediction then with a US/Russia conflict but then us still being allied in the next world war? Is there any kind of timeline to consider?\u201dRussia\u2019s historic enemies are the Turks, the Mongols, and particularly the Crimean Tatars. Russia has absolutely no reason to start a war with the West, as many people fear.As I\u2019ve been writing for many years, from the point of view of Generational Dynamics, Russia will be our ally in the coming Clash of Civilizations world war. Those who think that this is impossible should recall that the Soviet Union was our bitter enemy before and after World War II, but was our ally during World War II. Something like that will happen again. This prediction should make the Russian trolls very happy.Related ArticlesKEYS: Generational Dynamics, Russia, trolls, Syria, Bashar al-Assad, Vladimir Putin\n Permanent web link to this article\n Receive daily World View columns by e-mailNational Security, Bashar al-Assad, Generational Dynamics, Russia, Syria, trolls, Vladimir PutinComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The Archbishop has been criticized for his support of abortion and his willingness to lend his face to posters promoting the practice, as well as for his advocacy of gay marriage.In 1994, just as the Vatican was orchestrating a campaign against the United Nations\u2019 push for global \u201creproductive rights,\u201d including legal abortion worldwide, Tutu came out publicly in support of the UN platform.\u201cPlanned parenthood is an obligation of those who are Christians,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cOur church thinks we should use scientific methods that assist in planning of families.\u201dTutu has also been a vocal advocate for LGBT rights, and during the United Nation\u2019s launch of its \u201cFree & Equal\u201d campaign\u00a0in 2013, he said he would rather go to hell than to a \u201chomophobic heaven.\u201dThe Archbishop compared his advocacy for LGBT rights to his battle against apartheid, saying, \u201cI am as passionate about this campaign as I ever was about apartheid. For me, it is at the same level.\u201dThe Anglican Church has been embroiled in a deep internal battle over the question of homosexual practice. Earlier this year, the Nigerian Anglican primate, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, said that the Anglican communion seems to be tilting toward a non-biblical understanding of homosexuality, marginalizing those with an orthodox, biblical view of human sexuality.Traditional Anglicans, he said, \u201care walking into a well-rehearsed scheme to gradually apply persuasion, subtle blackmail, coercion on any group still standing with the Scriptural Provision as we know it, to join the straight jacket of the revisionists and be politically correct.\u201dFollow Thomas D.

Didn\u2019t he do wonderfully at the debate yesterday? The only time Hillary was more upset was during the White House\u2019s annual round of intern hires.Trump is now a changed, reformed man of course. But in his wilder days, he might describe what happened last night as a brutal schlonging.I mean, it had everything. He said Hillary should be in jail, he brought Bill\u2019s victims into the audience, and he insulted the moderator. It was perfect. I love him so much.As some of you may be aware, I was in New York City on Saturday to participate in a landmark art show, the first art show EVER specifically in favor of a republican candidate for president. We did a good job for Daddy, and I am incredibly pleased to have participated with my own avant garde performance art.New York can be mighty queer!In New York I was in a bathtub of pig\u2019s blood to protest the deaths of Americans at the hands of illegal aliens, Islamic terrorists, and lax policing.It would be easy to dismiss my performance art as attention seeking. As if anyone could ever seriously accuse me of attention seeking! But it was a sincere work that points out the victims of leftist policies.If you think illegal immigration is a problem only for the battlefields of Chicago and other big cities, or in the accounting offices trying to determine how to pay for the welfare benefits we stupidly give to illegals, you are wrong. This problem exists right here in Alabama too.In a last act of my performance art, I would like to hold a moment of silence for 19 year old Tad Mattle and 16 year old Leigh Anna Jimmerson from Huntsville, Alabama, who were killed in 2009 by a drunk driving illegal alien who had previously been arrested and was still allowed to remain in the country.Let\u2019s take a moment to remember these Alabamans, who never had the opportunity to attend The University of Alabama or any other college.Thank you.Of course, that\u2019s not the only moment of solemnity we have to have today. Because today marks the day of a great tragedy. Yes, it\u2019s Columbus Day.Yes\u2026 Five hundred and twenty four years ago, Columbus came and discovered America. And as you can see, the results were disastrous![SLIDE: Teepee Next To New York Skyline]\u00a0Moving on, I am very pleased to be back in the south, where I have spent the last month on tour. You\u2019ll probably assume it\u2019s the southern charms of polite and friendly people, beautiful scenery, and incredibly wonderful food which I sneak into the tour bus when my personal trainer isn\u2019t looking, but it is actually just the men\u2026. All the hot black men are in the south and no one told me!!!!But tonight we\u2019re going to be talking about a black man I find less attractive: intellectually, politically, and \u2026 well you know\u2026It\u2019s President Obama, and how he\u2019s just turned the internet over to monsters.What did Obama give away?\u00a0What was transferred from US control to the control of\u2026.well\u2026. No one is quite sure yet\u2026.. Is ICANN,\u00a0the Internet Corporation for Assigning Names and Numbers.ICANN makes hundreds of millions of dollars for controlling the naming on the Internet. In essence, they coordinate the names and numbered IP addresses of the entire Internet.Now bear with me for a minute, because I know you\u2019re all shitposters. The extent of your knowledge and interest in how the Internet works is how to get to porn, memes, and my youtube page. And 4chan of course \u2014 don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m working on saving it.But tonight we have to discuss a less exciting, but possibly more important aspect of the internet.If you\u2019ve ever wondered why you can type in a web address, like Twitter.com, from anywhere in the world and reach the same page, it\u2019s because of ICANN.Twitter may be a bad example actually. It\u2019s lost its most interesting and handsome user, fewer and fewer people use it, and the address might not exist much longer if they can\u2019t find a buyer\u2026. But you get the point.Let\u2019s compare the Internet to how people used to learn information, reading books. Does anyone here still read books? I guess some of you do \u2014 given that you\u2019re here at my talk, you are after all the students who still use your brains.So authors write books and publishers publish them. What would ICANN do in this case? They wouldn\u2019t be bookstores or libraries, and they aren\u2019t trucks carrying books to the stores or delivering them. Rather, they\u2019d ensure that anytime you picked up a book with a certain title by a certain author, you would get a copy of the correct book.You could look up the book I am writing \u2014 which will be amazing, by the way \u2014 and the ICANN of books would ensure that whether it was on amazon, your local bookseller, or a library, anywhere in the world, it would be the right book. On the Internet that is called DNS, and ICANN controls it. They would also have oversight on what title you choose for your book, by the way.I see some eyes glazing over, so I will wrap this section up with the important fact of how ICANN has operated. ICANN is a non-profit in California with a US government contract. They act as a monopoly, and have anti-trust exemption because of the US government\u2019s involvement.I know you\u2019re all conservatives, but rest assured that this is one instance in which the government has actually done a good job!Most crucially, because of U.S government involvement, ICANN must follow the first amendment \u2014 that pesky little law that authoritarians and the regressive left love to hate.Or rather, they used to. Because, thanks to Obama, ICANN is no longer in this great country\u2019s hands.Who did Obama give it to?Obama is the sort of American that believes everything about his own country is bad. You know the type. You\u2019ve probably met them in your gender studies department. He has worked to give away American control throughout his presidency, it started with bowing to world leaders all the time.His giveaway of ICANN might not even be constitutional, but then again, that\u2019s never stopped Obama before, has it?The short answer on who is taking over ICANN is that it is unclear. There are vague reports of a multinational organization. This is globalism in action ladies and gentlemen.Power handed over to opaque, vaguely-defined organizations free from any accountability.Tellingly, Google and all the usual Silicon Valley suspects are in favor of this change. They are the Soros types \u2014 the ones who are happy to use their power to impose their wacky progressive worldviews on everyone else.The other candidate isn\u2019t a corporation, or a government, but something much worse \u2014 the United Nations.Former US Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton recently said in an interview that within 10 years the Internet will be under UN control, and that the Internet as we know it will end.Those in favor of UN control of the government will usually say the same thing [whiney tone] \u201cInformation wants to be free, man, and it\u2019s like\u2026. TOTALLY wrong for the evil United States to monopolize it.\u201dThere is some truth there. Information and the Internet wants to be free \u2013 but only America has kept it free for so long. Only America with the first amendment has a true ideological and legal commitment to free speech. Countries around the world block portions of the internet and work to control what their citizens see, but the internet itself stayed free because ICANN was forced by the US government to keep it that way.Now, that will no longer be the case. Heaven help you if you are someone the member states of UN are not particularly fond of say\u2026. Oh\u2026\u2026 a dangerous faggot.These are countries known for their kebabs and murderous religious fanatics.And the cancer is spreading.In 2012 a UN treaty on Internet governance was signed by 89 countries. It wasn\u2019t signed by the US, because the US objected to language about international control of Internet governance.The head of the delegation said \u201cThe US has consistently believed and continues to believe that the UN treaty should not extend to Internet governance or content.\u201dIt only took four years for Obama to realize that his administration had actually done something good for freedom, and reverse it.In the words of one of my Breitbart colleagues, we are giving up control of the internet so that Turkey has as much say as America. We are doing that because Obama and friends thinks it is noble, that it is right to give all countries, no matter how despotic, a voice in managing the Internet.We know this is wrong. These countries don\u2019t deserve a voice on controlling the internet, because their M.O is censorship, oppression, and shadowy globalism.Let\u2019s take a look at the Rogue\u2019s gallery who will now control the Internet.First, China.\u00a0The Chinese in America are quite successful. Asian men, for example, have the highest average annual salaries in the United States. So much for white privilege!Some of the early pioneers of the Internet as we know it today were Chinese, like Jerry Yang who started Yahoo.Yahoo, of course, was once a great company, long before one of my favorite terrible female CEOs, Marissa Meyer, took the helm.But China\u2019s government is far more sinister and dangerous than its immigrants. After decades of murdering and starving their citizens, the Chinese turned their attention to controlling the internet.We have all heard of the great firewall of China, the complex methods China uses to filter vast portions of the Internet and block their citizenry from accessing information we take for granted. But that is just the start!In July, China banned online reporting. That would be \u201cbye bye Breitbart\u201d. If you\u2019re in China, only news from the government can be seen on the web now.You may think this is too far-fetched, but don\u2019t you think that Democratic administrations would love to shut down Breitbart? After all, Hillary Clinton talked about it in her alt-right speech, where she named my wonderful headlines as examples of wrongthink!China isn\u2019t even waiting for the UN to take over the Internet to mess around with it. China approached the owners of the .XYZ domain, which is now the fourth largest domain behind .com,.org and .net, to censor 12,000 words. They wanted to make sure no .xyz domains with politically unwelcome names would ever exist.For China, banned words include terms like \u201cDemocracy\u201d and \u201cLiberty\u201d. China and by extension the UN want an internet where a website cannot be called MiloForDemocracy.xyz and that is not the Internet you want to be on.Chinese citizens also have to be very careful what they post on social media, or they will be silenced.One quarter of the humans connected to the Internet live in China. Just imagine what that means. Except for the most clever and risk taking among them, one quarter of web users live a muzzled existence, cut off from the free flow of information and ideas.And a monitored one, of course. The ultimate goal of China and the UN is straight out of 1984. You don\u2019t know you\u2019ve violated the law until you\u2019ve been charged by the authorities.We should be challenging this country over its censorship, not giving it more power.\u00a0Next, Russia.Russia will assist China in ruining the Internet with the heavy hand of censorship. Russian Internet censorship rose 900 percent in 2015 according to human rights groups.One of the clever rules they\u2019ve developed is that any blogger that has more than 3000 readers must register with the government using all of their personal information, including their addresses. It\u2019s a not-very-subtle way of telling potentially influential dissidents: \u201cwe know where you live.\u201dThe Russian and Chinese model, followed by a growing number of nations, is to shut down so-called \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201csubversive\u201d websites. The definition of extremist and subversive is completely up to the government.Again, \u201cbye bye Breitbart,\u201d and bye bye dissidents, and anything else on the internet that globalists and authoritarian regimes deem to be \u201csubversive.\u201dWhy do we want corrupt officials and government cronies dictating what content is extremist and subversive?\u00a0And what about countries like Turkey? If a globalist behemoth like the U.N gets its claws on the internet, that will mean a backwards country like Turkey will have as much say as England. And Turkey\u2019s internet policies are as ugly as an overused goat\u2019s butthole.Turkey loves silencing social media, like Facebook and Youtube. And not just during coups either!Isn\u2019t it amazing that a country that has coups every second decade, that censors the internet, and has an Islamist President is a candidate for joining the European Union? These are supposed to be the \u201cgood Muslims.\u201d I\u2019m not impressed.Turkey has the sharia-compliant Twitter wrapped around their finger. They get whatever journalist they want booted off Twitter, and are the world leader for getting citizens banned from the platform.They also made it illegal to insult the president, and some poor bastard was arrested for making a meme comparing Turkish President Erdogan to Gollum.Most likely it is the first arrest in history for a meme. And it was an original one too! I mean, I know this will offend some of you, but after the 1 millionth Harambe joke I was in the mood for arresting people too.Turkey, like many countries, believe they have a sovereign right to control what information their citizens reach on the Internet. This is the opposite of what the Internet represents: the free exchange of information. And now, it is incontrovertible that Turkey and countries like it will have a greater say on how the Internet works. THANKS OBAMA!\u00a0Last, Saudi Arabia. Look, I couldn\u2019t possibly put this together without including Saudi Arabia. They are Hillary and Huma\u2019s BFFs, after all.Saudi Arabia follows the latest censorship tactics from the bad guys I\u2019ve already mentioned.\nIn 2014 they had 400,000 websites blocked, I wonder what the total is now? I\u2019ve found that block lists, whether they\u2019re from authoritarian regimes or triggered feminists only tend to get larger, not smaller. The lists always balloon, because censorship is both seductive and addicting.Much of the blocking is requested by religious leaders, and Saudi Arabia says its censorship is defending Islamic values.Presumably they aren\u2019t censoring the pedophile sites then!So while the west is flooded with muslim refugees who seek benefits in exchange for rape and murder, you can expect the Internet of the future to be as Sharia-Compliant as Twitter is today.I doubt they will find Tinder and Grindr to be very halal. In fact most porn is probably in danger, at least if the performers are over the age of nine.Ironically they will probably be perfectly fine with sites featuring interspecies action.Who on earth thinks letting Muslim nations have a say on how the Internet runs and what sort of sites should be allowed is a good idea? Your president, Barack Obama.\u00a0As I said earlier, control of the Internet will probably end up with the United Nations. There are lots of problems with that.One of them is that the UN loves taking up kooky feminist causes. If you thought Mugabe addressing the United Nations was bad, check these dykes out:If Anita Sarkeesian doesn\u2019t like being called an odious mendacious c**t, maybe she should stop being an odious mendacious c**t. It\u2019s not about her gender, it\u2019s about the bullshit that comes out of her mouth.A feminist controlled Internet is very dangerous. They hate masculinity, they hate men, and they also hate a nebulous term they use, \u201cCyber-Violence.\u201dCyber-violence, like \u201conline harassment\u201d and other terms cooked up by loopy feminist activists, is defined as anything that hurts feminists\u2019 feelings. Imagine the UN censoring everything that makes women unhappy.I mean, Chinese censorship is almost better! In their case at least you only have to worry about the Politburo\u2019s feelings, which are relatively stable. They don\u2019t go completely mental once a month.In late 2015 the UN put out a completely insane report called \u201cCyber Violence Against Women And Girls: A Global Wake-up Call\u201d which said:\u201cA cyber-touch is recognised as equally as harmful as a physical touch.\u201dIf only Father Michael had JUST cyber touched me when I was five \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be such a fag.In their press release, UN Women claim that \u201ccyber violence \u2026 places a premium on emotional bandwidth.\u201dThe report was so poorly put together that many references were left blank, and one, in fact, linked to one of the researchers\u2019 local hard drives. These people want to censor the internet and they don\u2019t even know how it works!Can you imagine what would happen if this organization got a hold of the internet? We\u2019d have to hope that their incompetence is stronger than their will to censor.That might just be the case. After all, the UN is notable for fucking up everything it sticks its nose into.Control of the Internet is like virginity. Once you give it away, you will never ever EVER get it back. That\u2019s why I carefully picked a special, romantic occasion \u2014 an interracial fivesome with two drag queens.America must control the Internet for the good of the entire world. Free speech is the essential component of freedom, and both in this country and around the world people must be able to speak out, learn, and participate in Internet culture.We must be able to do so without the control of Russia, China, and the Muslim world. We should be fighting those nations for control of the internet, not giving in.Thanks to the Obama administration, we must now add the Internet to the list of things that Donald Trump must save for America. I don\u2019t put much hope in congress stopping ICANN. After all, the Republican caucus still includes Paul Ryan.It\u2019s up to daddy, and to all of us, to fix this. Vote for Trump, spread the word, and educate your fellow students so they don\u2019t wake up one day to find that their favorite porn sites and the Milo homepage, which should be the same thing, are banned from the Internet.Follow\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero)\u00a0on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.

The professor has since taken leave, according to the university.\u201dIn response to criticism from the University of Virginia community, Muir deleted not only the controversial post but his entire Twitter account as well.A screenshot that was taken before Muir\u2019s deletion reveals that his comment\u00a0stated: \u201cBlack lives matter is the biggest rasist (sic) organisation (sic) since the clan (sic). Are you kidding me. Disgusting!!!\u201d On another note\u2026I will NEVER frequent @Bellasrestaurant again. I met Doug Muir for the first time a couple of weeks ago at the @tomtomfestival\u2026and I didn't expect this from him, but if this is how he feels, he doesn't have anything else to say to me. I would encourage everyone in the city to boycott the restaurant. I would also implore the @theuniversityofvirginia and the Darden School of Business @dardenmba (One that's celebrating Diversity Week)  to address this issue immediately. The notion that #BlackLivesMatter can be comparable to the Klu Klux Klan is not only incredibly misguided, but goes to show the lack cultural awareness that still plagues many professors at our Universities across the country. An organization, a movement, a collective body that aims to empower Black People, and rally allies is not a terroristic organization, but one that aims to collective bring people together to address systemic oppression and racism, amongst other things, is here to stay.

While the statement claims that the university believes in the importance of free speech and open discussion, it condemns Muir\u2019s comment as \u201centirely inappropriate.\u201dA recent comment regarding the Black Lives Matter movement, posted on social media by Doug Muir, a lecturer in our School, has raised serious concerns about UVA Engineering\u2019s commitment to diversity, inclusion and support of populations that are traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.While free speech and open discussion are fundamental principles of our nation and the University, Mr. Muir\u2019s comment was entirely inappropriate. UVA Engineering does not condone actions that undermine our values, dedication to diversity and educational mission. Our faculty and staff are responsible for upholding our values and demonstrating them to students and the community. Mr. Muir has agreed to take leave and is preparing his own statement to the community.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

The 1960\u2019s southern-fried crime drama is a brand new look for 2K\u2019s\u00a0cult classic Mafia franchise, and it\u2019s been turning heads even before the wildly elaborate E3 2016 display.Unfortunately \u2014 at least on PC \u2014 it seems to be starting its run\u00a0in a pair of cement shoes.It began with the discovery of a 30 frames-per-second lock on the PC port. That alone is enough to drive the hardcore PC gamer crowd a little bit wild, but in and of itself is not an irredeemable sin. Unfortunately, my\u00a0time with the game has already proven even that 30 FPS to be\u00a0uneven and jittery. It doesn\u2019t seem to be traditional slowdown \u2014 it\u2019s a difficult to define \u201cshuddering\u201d that isn\u2019t helped by the already low frame rate and some intensely smeary motion blur.Objects sometimes pop in and out of the screen seemingly at random, and some fail to load altogether. Some textures appear to be locked at the lowest level-of-detail, or else are bizarrely low resolution in comparison to the surrounding scenery. There are some mystifying artifacts in the aliasing as well, causing the edges of objects to flicker with jagged white lines unless directly under a bright light source.2K and Hangar 13 are already aware of the issues. Even before the official launch, they\u2019d\u00a0issued an apologetic blog post promising improvements to future performance. Since then, it\u2019s been updated to announce a patch this weekend that\u00a0\u201cincludes 30, 60, and unlimited frames-per-second options in the video menu, among other improvements for the PC version of Mafia III.\u201dUnless Hangar 13\u2019s development talents include time manipulation, it also seems as if they would have had to have known about these problems beforehand. Why they didn\u2019t choose to delay the game by a day or two in order to avoid the deluge of bad press and angry consumers is unclear.We\u2019ll provide our own review \u2014 beyond these initial missteps \u2014 \u00a0in the coming days.Follow\u00a0Nate\u00a0Church\u00a0@Get2Church\u00a0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.Tech, Mafia III, video gamesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Despite the success of the school\u2019s graduates, Bucknell students have become increasingly convinced that they are being held back by institutional oppression and discrimination.Jorden Sneed, 21, of Los Angeles and a senior at Bucknell, said she has attended the rally and march every year since she\u00a0started college.When she first started to come to the rally, she said they were much more intimate and shorter. However, \u201csentiments towards this march have changed since so much has changed in the world.\u201dSneed said, \u201cit is nice to see more people value the Solidarity March in the community. I believe it\u2019s important to have these rallies, marches, and events as it allows for our communities, Lewisburg and Bucknell, to come together on exposing these social issues that impact many of us on a daily basis.\u201dFellow Bucknell student Grevelin Ulerio, who performed Billie Holiday\u2019s classic protest song \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d and gave a small speech during the rally, said she wanted to tackle issues like white supremacy and anti-blackness head on.The 19-year-old sophomore, of Bronx, New York, originally planned to sing \u201cA Change is Gonna Come\u201d but changed her mind as she thought it was important to show what it means to be a black person in society.\u201cA lot of people see race as an identity, not as a position within society,\u201d Ulerio, who is a first generation Dominican American, said.Despite the seemingly well-intentioned sentiment of the event, the march merely operated as an extension of the calculated narrative being pushed throughout much of higher education.Ideas that counter the academy\u2019s narrative have become heresy. Those with an invested interest in the future of American education must begin to close their wallets and open their mouths if\u00a0tides are going to reverse anytime soon.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

The new technology is allowing drones to create accurate three-dimensional maps and observe how they change over time, which could prove useful for infrastructure projects, verifying insurance claims and also for security applications, PwC said.But with a 6,000 percent growth expectancy by the end of the decade, rogue drone activity is increasingly in the news for interfering with fighting wildfires, running into commercial passenger jets, blocking policing, and invading personal privacy.As blowback, a Kentucky judge last year dismissed all charges against William Merideth for shooting down a drone flying over his home, based on the citizen\u2019s right to protect his privacy. The ruling kicked off a number of states moving to pass laws authorizing police, firefighters and other public safety officials the right to blow pesky drones out of the sky.The potential mainstreaming of vigilante activity\u00a0caused the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to issue an extraordinary national bulletin stating that under federal statute 18 U.S.C. 32, it is a felony crime to shoot down any aircraft, including drones.With increasing numbers of individuals firing errant bullets at quadcopters, the FAA warned, \u201cregardless of the situation, shooting at any aircraft \u2014 including unmanned aircraft \u2014 poses a significant safety hazard. An unmanned aircraft hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air. \u201dMany of the worst drone-war offenders are the burgeoning corps of free-lance photographers who can immediately sell \u201cbreaking\u201d overhead scenes of blood, gore or controversy to competitive media outlets for big bucks.To reduce the renegade droners\u2019 financial incentives, the U.S. Department of the Interior has begun a pilot program to give real-time access to data on all active wildfires to a couple of airspace mapping companies.Southern California-based AirMap is working with drone manufacturer DJI to create \u201cgeofences\u201d around wildfires. When a drone intruder hits the designated virtual boundary, geofencing software overrides the drone intruder\u2019s flight controller programing and forces the drone to hover in place. Any intruding drone attempting to launch inside \u201cgeofenced\u201d area will also be unable to lift off.Mark Bathrick, director of the office of aviation services at the Department of the Interior, told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cWe really want to have this new community of pilots be as responsible as the manned aircraft pilots that came before them.\u201dOther U.S. regulatory agencies are trying to get ahead of the rising\u00a0number of drone owners who\u00a0might try to interfere with such sensitive and high-risk areas such as airports, military installations, nuclear power plants, and prisons.Los Angeles avoided a potentially catastrophic event on March 19 at 2 a.m., when a full Lufthansa Airbus A380 passenger jet 14 miles out from LAX and descending to 5,000 feet on final approach only missed a drone by 200 feet, according to the FAA.Big builders of military drones like Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., along with a gaggle of start-ups, have all announced new initiatives to develop drone counter-measures \u2014 such as detection systems, controller interruption and laser cannons that can fry unwanted drones without spewing bullets that risk wounding or killing civilians.At the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s annual counter-drone demonstration, called Black Dart, the military revealed Boeing\u2019s compact laser weapons system, which\u00a0can disable or explode targeted drones in 15 seconds with a 2-kilowatt laser.Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, told the Times that with the commercial drone industry already experiencing exponential growth, counter-drone growth is likewise accelerating rapidly.\u00a0Breitbart California, Economics, Tech, Drone, FAA, geofenced, geofences, geofencingComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street9 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0L&F Capital Management suggests that Snapchat\u2019s current advantages are easily replicated, and that \u201cInstagram will ultimately consolidate the teen user base.\u201dThey see a Snapchat IPO as another one-trick-pony like GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK). All three had hot IPO\u2019s and a big jump in price in the first few days of trading. But within a year, competition swooped in and the companies\u2019 stock prices crumbled.A recent Wishbone survey targeting 35,000 Snapchat users between the ages of 12 and 25 found the company\u2019s primary competitive advantage is its filters. Geo filters and puppy dog faces are what the youth demographic currently wants for viral \u201cfun.\u201d But the survey also revealed that if Facebook had Snapchat-type filters, it would take market share from Snapchat\u2019s 12 to 25-age demographic.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram Stories launched on August 2, and already has 100 million daily active viewers, compared to Snapchat\u2019s 150 million users after almost five years. A big part of Instagram Stories\u2019 rapid adoption has probably been due to \u201cimmersion\u201d within the 500 million users in Instagram\u2019s ecosystem.L&F is confident that Facebook can continue to grow its earnings by 30 percent compounded, because the falling \u201cCost per Engagement\u201d for the Instagram and Facebook platform is a magnet for advertiser dollars and an impediment for other social media platforms.Snapchat is the primary target in the\u00a0Facebook\u2019s app consolidation plans. By knocking off Snapchat\u2019s core features, Facebook will strengthen its user base and take share in the youth demographic, where advertisers desperately want to increase engagement.Snapchat currently has an advantage when it comes to private direct messaging, but that feature is easily imitated. Facebook is already testing a similar tool with Messenger. By enabling short-lived direct messaging text, photos and videos, Messenger would seem to be a huge threat to Snapchat\u2019s value proposition to users.Instagram Stories already addresses the public messaging components, and when combined with Facebook Messenger features, it could also offer the kid-targeted private component.L&F believes that with all the hype around Snapchat, the stock price will undoubtedly jump after the IPO. But it also expects Snapchat to be\u00a0\u201cbutchered\u201d as reality sinks in that the company does not have \u201cprotectable\u201d value.Breitbart California, Tech, engagement, facebook, Fitbit, GoPro, Instagram Stories, ipo, Messenger, Shake ShackComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

There is a problem when perfectly respectable, reasonable, mainstream opinions become prescribed by the media. What I\u2019m about to do is draw attention to something they don\u2019t really want to speak about very often, they don\u2019t want to talk about this often. I\u2019m a gay man who flew down to Orlando after an Islamic lunatic murdered fifty people and injured another fifty, after seeing what has happened in Britain and Europe, as a warning from the continent, I don\u2019t want you to go the same way.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want America to become like Germany. With accident and emergency departments where doctors are being spat on because they\u2019re female. And doctors are being stabbed because fail to save the lives of male children. I don\u2019t want America to become that because we rely on you guys, we love you, we trust you and we rely on you, without a strong America we\u2019re left with China and Russia so coming from Europe, having seen what the sort of weak, globalist politics does for people.\u201d\u201cHaving seen what left wing establishment politics accomplishes when it is allowed to run riot, I want to come to you here in America to tell you that there is a different way, there\u2019s a better way and it is cleaving to the principles on which this country was founded. It is remembering that freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, capitalism, property rights, these are the things that make America the best country in the history of human civilization.\u201d\u201cAmerica is the kindest country to minorities, it treats women, blacks, gays, trannies, whatever minority you choose to identify with, it treats them the\u00a0best out of any country anywhere in the world and when the left looks at this country it sees a history of oppression, bigotry and constructs a variety of conspiracy theories as to why they\u2019re still f**king unhappy. When I look at America coming from Europe, which is a relatively enlightened continent, I see country which has taken the best of humanity, freedom of expression, property rights, all of the things that allowed people to flourish and its created a country out of those ideas. This is not a country not created out of ethnicity or geography, this is a country created\u00a0according to reason and ideals and those ideals are the best basis\u00a0that anybody has yet come up with, with which to found a country.\u201d\u201cThe left, Hillary Clinton being the largest and greatest incarnation of that, the left in America is determined to unravel the founding documents of this country. They hate the first amendment, they hate the second amendment. You cannot allow that to happen, they cannot allow the identity politics of the left to take control of your civil society. You cannot allow the progressive left to start privileging Islamic terrorists over women and gays who\u00a0already live here. \u00a0You cannot allow the insane identity politics, the ludicrous and prejudiced, bigoted crazy ideas of the left to distort the principals that created the best nation that our species has come up with\u201dThe event can be watched in full at the livestream below.Milo, Tech, #DaddyWillSaveUs, Donald Trump, Lucian WintrichComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He was thrown out of his first venue and faced legal threats over his proposed exhibit.Shortly before\u00a0the groundbreaking show got underway, he sat down for a phone interview with Breitbart Tech\u2019s\u00a0Allum Bokhari about the event,\u00a0the controversy surrounding it, and the thoughts of the man behind it all.Allum Bokhari: When\u2019s the last time that this has happened, that someone was barred from a gallery for the politics of their exhibit?Lucian Wintrich: I believe it was Mapplethorpe and it was the conservative Christians and evangelicals (who were protesting). It is an example that the left is just as if not more reactionary.A: Do you think the scales have tipped then, that it\u2019s now the left who are the new \u201cMoral Majority?\u201dL: I think that the scales have more than tipped. You look at the left right now saying \u201cyeah we\u2019re gonna beat the shit out of you, watch your back.\u201d When the Christians were protesting that, they weren\u2019t necessarily inciting violence; they were saying \u201cyeah we\u2019re not gonna touch you but you\u2019ll burn in hell later on.\u201d So I think I\u2019d prefer that threat. I have been a little bit freaked out (by the leftist protesters) but at the same time, these people are so used to that method of intimidation and coercion that it\u2019s sort of worn thin I think.A: So tell me about yourself. How does a gay photographer who works for media companies in New York become a Trump supporter?L: Well I absolutely despise Clinton and I think Trump is a brilliant representation and embodiment of how we can help turn around what I feel to be a terrible direction that this country is currently headed in. Clinton\u2019s so untrustworthy and such a panderer that she will find the lowest common denominator, regressive emotion which stifles culture, stifles art. It holds us back and it puts us in a place that Germany knew very very well until cultural notions sort of took hold there. And now they\u2019re sort of crashing and burning and I think that will very soon be seen in their economyA: Are you referring to Germany\u2019s immigration problem?L: Yes, yes, mostly I think it\u2019s a combination of their immigration and they have the same sort of regressive oversensitivity where \u201cmy god we can\u2019t really say anything, we need to respect every single thing that we\u2019re told to respect\u201d and it\u2019s tip toeing. When did Western culture become so scared of Western culture? It\u2019s unfortunate and I think Trump is helping to change that. Even this nonsense that came out where he was accidentally recorded or left the lavalier on his jacket on. The people that are saying \u201cthis is outrageous, this is disgusting,\u201d I don\u2019t know if they have friends and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve ever just sat down at a bar for an hour. I mean that is typically how a lot of Americans talk and I feel like fifty years ago it would have been laughed off. There\u2019s also this thing going on right now in the world where almost everything is recorded and everything is documented and filmed and photographed. Either we have future politicians in one of those Plato\u2019s republic type of scenarios where they\u2019re not exposed to any elements of the more crass elements of American culture and then we throw them into the American eye after they\u2019ve lived this sheltered closed life\u2026A: Isn\u2019t that what Clinton is to some extent? She\u2019s been in politics for more than half her life.L: Oh she really is and she\u2019s bringing back a bunch of cronies who are part of that world where their actual only job is to maintain power. They were raised and they were continuously told all they had to do was maintain power at any cost. Trump not so much. I mean he definitely has a sense of capitalism and business power, the whole point of business is to advance but it\u2019s completely different to the coercive power of politics. Which is why I\u2019m more of Goldwater conservative. Some of Trump\u2019s policies I think might be as wonderful as those of Goldwater and he does still embody a large portion of the conservative spirit and conservative ideology. People say \u201cwell Hillary Clinton is more conservative than some Republicans\u201d and yeah, but the parts of her that are conservative are the worst parts of the platform. And what Trump has absorbed from the conservative party and the American populace in forming his policies I think is vastly more reflective of the climate we\u2019re in right now and what we need to advance as a country.A: Why did you choose the artists that you chose?L: Over the course of the last month or so a bunch of my pieces were sort of propagating online, a lot of other conservatives, about 50 conservative artists reached out to me. Some of them were terrible, as is to be expected, and some of them were fantastic. And I think what I really was going for in the final selection of artist was diversity of ideologies within the party, different worldviews, and as many mediums as possible, so we don\u2019t really have too many of the same form of art. Obviously with Milo, he gave a drag performance in front of 2500 young Republicans at LSU, so that is like a form of educational performance art. I think Milo\u2019s talk is absolutely brilliant art and I don\u2019t think a lot of people recognise that. I\u2019m especially excited about Milo\u2019s piece. \u00a0A lot of people on the left expect to hate him. They have no idea what he\u2019s actually doing, what he\u2019s saying and what the actual cultural benefit is of what he\u2019s achieving right now. He\u2019s a brilliant conservative mind and he\u2019s absolutely an artist and so with this show, we\u2019re putting it in New York which is the heart of the art world. So we\u2019re taking an artist to a place where many people don\u2019t know that his character is a large part of his art and we\u2019re bringing him into that world. So it\u2019ll be interesting to see how people react to that and if they sort of, I dunno, everythings open to interpretation.A: There was talk of potential protests by activists ahead of the event. Do you envision any trouble?L: I think literally anything could happen. I think that the protesters might just be pussies because of the rain, maybe they won\u2019t show up. I haven\u2019t heard anything leaked through the grapevine, I tend to think liberals are generally stupid but maybe they got smarter and figured out a better way to execute this. But really anything could happen, very luckily we do have four navy seals working security, we have the new york fire department, so I don\u2019t think they can slip in necessarily. This is a fairly controversial show so I don\u2019t know. If the birdman can break out of Alcatraz then I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one liberal was able to slip through the doors.A: People talk about the enthusiasm gap, and\u00a0I don\u2019t see many art shows being planned for Hillary. A lot of people are voting for her because they hate Trump or they just don\u2019t want the Republicans to win, but they don\u2019t seem very enthusiastic about her. Do you think this art show is another example of this gap? I mean, I don\u2019t think there\u2019d be an art show for Jeb Bush either\u2026L: I do think that there\u2019s far more young people excited for Trump than there are excited for Hillary and that\u2019s sort of everything. If you read all the arguments for supporting Hillary they\u2019re just \u201coh well she\u2019s better than Trump.\u201d And that sort of notion or idea that \u201coh ok well I guess mom if we\u2019re having Tofu for dinner it\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d that\u2019s not really going to elicit the same sort of excitement and an expression in the art as a candidate like Trump. And I think inherently he lends himself to art. He\u2019s a celebrity and before this election he was a very loved figure by everybody, left or right in New York and he\u2019s a pop culture icon. So we\u2019re just sort of translating that to a variety of mediums.A: Final question:\u00a0you mentioned Germany and western culture earlier, do you think artists these days, especially left leaning ones, tend to not be so keen on western culture, would you like to see more artists celebrate western culture instead of denigrate itL: Oh absolutely! Absolutely! If not for western culture they wouldn\u2019t have the ability to express themselves, the enlightenment in the arts and literature and everything else, it\u2019s a byproduct of western culture. It\u2019s unfortunate and I do think that a lot of artists are very politically stupid and I know plenty of truly incredible artists in New York who are brilliant painters and brilliant photographers and they\u2019re so blind and led by leftists because that\u2019s the culture that they know. I think they have a wonderful sort of technical skill but no real understanding of what they\u2019re talking about politically.You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.\u00a0Email tips and suggestions to abokhari@breitbart.com.Milo, Tech, #DaddyWillSaveUs, Lucian WintrichComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street8 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Luckey created Oculus Rift from a small dollar Kickstarter campaign in 2012, and then sold it two years later to Facebook for $2 billion. Since the acquisition, Luckey has become the celebrity \u201cface of virtual reality in gaming\u201d tens of thousands of first mover enthusiasts.Despite being a billionaire, Luckey\u2019s standard garb has been sandals, shorts and Hawaiian shirts at national conferences. He also lives in a shared house with several others top-ranked multiplayer videogamers.But as Breitbart News reported in late September, Luckey was outed as the anonymous billionaire behind a $10,000 donation to \u2018Nimble America\u2019, a pro-Donald Trump group that the Left claims are alt-right and white supremacy advocates. Nimble has been very active at posting negative stories about the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton online \u2013 a practice the Left calls \u201cshit-posting.\u201dA number of VR developers, including Scruta Games and Tomorrow Today Labs, have claimed they will not give their support to the roll-out of Oculus Touch as long as Luckey remains at the company. \u00a0But the loss of Luckey would also cause huge dissention from his legions of avid social media followers.Despite having to follow Google\u2019s highly-touted $79 \u201cDaydream VR\u201d fabric encrusted stand-alone peripheral for their new Pixel phone line that premiered two days earlier, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seamlessly slipped into Luckey\u2019s role to host 2,000 attendees in San Jose for the Oculus Connect 3 developer conference that began on October 6.Zuckerberg quickly crushed all the back-biting and the political friction regarding Luckey by announcing that Facebook intends to add another $250 million to the $250 million the company has already invested in developing virtual reality (VR) applications.Zuckerberg commented, \u201cWe should [all] build software and experiences that follow the way our minds work and the way we process the world.\u201d He then astounded developers by unveiling a new prototype wireless version of its\u00a0Oculus\u00a0Rift headset.The Bluetooth enabled device is Oculus\u2019 third VR and by far the most powerful device. The prototype uses a headset camera for its software to determine the position of the user within a millimeter, a technique Oculus calls \u201cinside-out tracking\u201d. Current Oculus systems rely on a much less precise system of cameras and sensors in the same room.Eric Florenzano, Oculus VR senior software engineer recruited from Twitter, commented that \u201cinside-out tracking\u201d has the potential to be an entirely new product category. He highlighted, \u201cIf the device can track your position in a room, you could leave the room where the device is and even walk outside. It starts to blur the line between virtual and augmented reality.\u201dZuckerberg demonstrated a couple of very engaging applications. AltSpace VR will allow up to eight Oculus VR users to enter in a virtual world as liquid-metal avatars. The participants can hang-out and chat, or engage in realistic play, like fencing.By adding an Oculus\u2019s Touch handset, Zuckerberg was able to mimic using a selfie stick to take a virtual reality picture of himself and his wife Priscilla Chan, then seamlessly post to Facebook with a single hand swipe.Despite Oculus only having about 1 million Oculus VR users worldwide, compared to Facebook\u2019s 1.1 billion users, Zuckerberg emphasized that virtual reality will eventually dominate social media.As a sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment to move ahead with the attendees that came to Oculus Connect 3, Zuckerberg announced that Oculus was launching a $10 million development fund at the conference to drive a rapid expansion into educational content.Breitbart California, Education, Tech, facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, Oculus Connect 3, Oculus Touch, Oculus VR, palmer luckeyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

They are instead scrambling to stop Cassie Jaye, a filmmaker whose documentary on the men\u2019s rights movement called The Red Pill\u00a0was premiered tonight in New York.Today, feminists are getting ulcers not from their horrific diets, but from a self-identified feminist who has serious bona fides both as a filmmaker and a friend to lefty causes like marriage equality. This is the type of woman who liberals typically would fall over themselves to praise with compliments like brave and stunning.But they won\u2019t be so complimentary this time, because Jaye\u00a0has made a film on a topic feminism doesn\u2019t want the public to hear about, and she has done it fairly, which means feminism can\u2019t afford for anyone, most especially women, to see it.The Red Pill sets out to explore the men\u2019s rights movement through interviews with MRA leaders like Paul Elam, feminists that oppose the movement, video footage of events and graphics and animations highlighting particular issues. Although many were skeptical of Jaye\u2019s\u00a0ability to fairly represent men\u2019s rights activists, she has, I think, succeeded.Jaye\u2019s\u00a0budget ended up directly on screen. Her style keeps things visually interesting when they could otherwise turn boring quickly. I was impressed by the graphics she uses, which become especially devastating as the hate-facts on topics such as military deaths start rolling.The graphics in this documentary are some of the most visually appealing\u00a0anti-feminist images I\u2019ve ever seen, outside of my own YouTube channel of course and that of the Factual Feminist, Christina Hoff Sommers.This is a film that made me feel a variety of emotions, and that is no mean feat when the viewer\u2019s heart is as cold and black as mine. You can expect to find humor at various points, become angry at feminists assaulting police officers and pulling fire alarms and disgust at the holier-than-thou pronouncements from academics and activists.One of my staff members, a father of two, reported tearing up at one interviewee\u2019s description of the struggles he went through in family court and the toll the process had on both his health and his son\u2019s health. The story is anecdotal, but anecdotes humanize the subject in a way statistics never can.This is not a movie short on statistics by the way, they are discussed in detail and shown on the screen throughout.The other emotion I experienced was horror at numerous short scenes of Jaye\u00a0driving around. I had to peek through my fingers expecting a crash at any moment. I freely recognize this is a personal hangup, not everyone shares my well-known fear of femsteering.Jaye\u2019s\u00a0interview style is to focus on the thoughts of her subject, and then to comment on what they\u2019ve said afterwards in voiceover. I found it to be effective, but there were times with both feminists and MRAs where I wished she was more confrontational during the interview.Another device she\u00a0uses effectively is to insert her own video journals into the documentary in order to chronicle her reactions to what she has learned. I found these interesting and felt\u00a0that Jaye\u00a0was sincerely sharing her opinions and emotions. The Red Pill includes some snippets of her acting at the beginning, and with all due respect I don\u2019t think she has the chops to fake these journals.The video journals add a secondary plot to The Red Pill: the red-pilling of Cassie Jaye herself. Unfortunately these journals seem to disappear in the latter part of the movie and this thread is not as fully realised\u00a0as it could be.The Red Pill includes interviews with a variety of activists on both sides of the men\u2019s rights debate. Some of the interviewees are impressive both in their appearance and in their material. Others are a bit harder to watch.My chief complaint about The Red Pill is that almost all of the men\u2019s rights activists interviewed are older men. The casual viewer might come away thinking that MRAs are all middle-aged. Why is there almost no representation of younger men, who face their own unique challenges?I\u2019d love to have seen Jaye\u00a0interview a man kicked out of a school by a kangaroo court because a female student regretted a consensual sexual encounter. As readers of my work will know, I\u2019ve chronicled the increasing problems faced by younger men in pieces like the Sexodus.The film includes an interview with the infamous \u201cBig Red,\u201d an angry Canadian feminist notable primarily for looking like the love child of a bad Canadian Michael Jackson impersonator and Elmo from Sesame Street. I would have thought it a good opportunity to counterpoint her with a young MRA.But my gripes are minor. The Red Pill is a powerful film on a complicated, important, yet woefully unaddressed issue. I applaud Jaye for having the intestinal fortitude to not only tackle this subject, but to do so fairly. After all, it would have been much easier to produce a documentary on how wonderful feminism is and how stunningly brave Emma Watson is for fighting the horrors of being called bossy as a child.I\u2019m not going to give away any more of The Red Pill because you need to watch it yourself. I will point out my favorite part, which is Karen Straughan blowing feminism out of the room by illustrating the horrors of Boko Haram before \u201cBring back our girls\u201d became a liberal clarion call.I found it delightful that Karen was interviewed in a noisy bar: talk about a perfect setting. I can tell you this \u2014 everyone concerned about men\u2019s rights should thank God that Karen Straughan is on your\u00a0side.There is another theme teased out\u00a0by\u00a0The Red Pill, which is that feminists will always, always try to shut down those who\u00a0disagree with them. Two interviewees describe this explicitly: Erin Pizzey, who opened shelters for both men and women, is not welcome at the very shelters she founded, because her views are not politically correct.Warren Farrell describes a similar experience: as his interests changed from women\u2019s rights to men\u2019s rights, his speaking engagements and other projects simply dried up.Jaye is herself an example of this phenomenon.\u00a0The picture was almost not made\u00a0due to lack of funding. It was only after I covered Jaye here at Breitbart\u00a0that it was funded well above its target. I am pleased to report that Milo fans, Mike Cernovich and the wider men\u2019s rights movement did not fund the\u00a0project in vain.The Red Pill does not yet have a digital distribution deal, but you can keep an eye on the\u00a0website for ways to see the film. While you wait, enjoy the wave of feminist harpies attempting to tear it apart. There is already a review from The Village Voice which apologizes for \u2018taking the bait\u2019 by reviewing The Red Pill.Who are they fooling? They wake up every morning with the sole aim of being offended.My message to Cassie Jaye is a simple one: buckle up and prepare for every slimy outlet in the mainstream media (which is most of them) to come after you. You\u2019ve done the unthinkable. You\u2019ve made a fair-minded documentary about feminism\u2019s most hated target.As always, hatred from the\u00a0mainstream media is the best advertising one\u00a0could hope for, especially with the group that could gain the most from The Red Pill, young men and women who distrust the media and are witnessing the fall-out of radical feminism on America\u2019s campuses on a daily basis.Madeleine Albright infamously said, \u201cThere is a special place in hell for women that don\u2019t help women\u201d, and if that\u2019s true, The Red Pill has earned Cassie Jaye her own spot there. On the bright side, she will have women like Karen Straughan to hang out with. And me, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m looking forward to our infernally fabulous brunch dates.Follow\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero)\u00a0on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.

Tickets are still available for purchase via IndieGoGo.The Daily Beast\u00a0took an in-depth look inside Wintrich\u2019s operation in the run-up to the event, as well as the controversy raging around it.Lucian Wintrich is pacing the floor of his East Village walkup, chain-smoking cigarettes and drinking white wine. It is 2:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday, and a little more than 48 hours until Wintrich\u2019s performance art show, #DaddyWillSaveUs, which Wintrich is billing as the first pro-Trump art show in the nation\u2019s history, is set to open.\u201cArt show,\u201d however, is perhaps not the right phrase. #DaddyWillSaveUs was more of a chance for liberals\u2019, or, for that matter, mainstream Americans\u2019 most hated villains to come together to see if they could offend people further. The show is a museum piece of precisely the kind of degraded public culture that Trump had unleashed, dropping its pants before anyone who dares believe civil norms can still be saved.Besides infamous tech bro Shkreli, who has apparently taken up sculpture in his spare time (and who seems to be under the impression that Wintrich will actually assemble the installation, hence the \u201cfucking around\u201d), Wintrich said the show is slated to feature Internet provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos bathing in a tub of pig\u2019s blood (to showcase Islamic anti-gay violence)The article goes on to describe Wintrich\u2019s attempts to secure a venue for the event, from the tumultuous cancellation of his first option,\u00a0to problems securing the second.It was because of Yiannopoulos that one of their back-up places fell through. The space didn\u2019t have two exits, which Yiannopoulos\u2019s security team said is necessary since his performances so often attract death threats. Other back-ups were falling through too. The Columbia University College Republicans offered to help find a space, but it would have required everyone to be pre-registered. A place in Long Island City looked promising; but Wintrich and Akbar wanted the commotion, or at least to plant a flag in the heart of the gallery district of Brooklyn. Another feared that as soon as word got out about the show, the owner of the building, \u201ca flaming liberal,\u201d would demand its cancellation. They thought of reaching out to Trump, but didn\u2019t know how to get hold of him. They called New York Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, who brushed them, and the American Civil Liberties Union, which said they couldn\u2019t much help them either.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of those conservatives who see a conspiracy everywhere,\u201d said Wintrich. \u201cBut there is a real conspiracy here.\u201dHe pointed to an email that the culture writer Jamie Peck sent to some hundreds of her writer friends suggesting that they collectively ignore \u201cDaddy Will Save Us.\u201d Someone on the list sent it to Wintrich, who promptly sent it toBreitbart, fanning the flames even further. Proceeds from the show\u2014tickets cost between $65 and $125\u2014were meant to go to a charity that helped gay veterans. But another liberal media outlet shamed the non-profit from participating, and they said they wouldn\u2019t accept the money. \u201cOh now look at this,\u201d Wintrich said holding up his laptop. \u201cJames Michael Nichols of the\u00a0Huffington Post is calling me a homo-nationalist.\u201dHe doubled over with laughter.This was of course the point too. The bigger the protest, the more publicity they would get, and the whole point of the whole thing, about who is entitled to free expression and who isn\u2019t, would be confirmed. The culture wars would have at last flipped sides. Whereas before it was conservatives from the Catholic League protesting Andres Serrano\u2019s \u201cPiss Christ,\u201d now it would be liberals protesting drag queens lying in vats of pig\u2019s blood, never mind that they would be protesting not the art or the expression so much as the unapologetically racist and provocative performances.Read the full piece at\u00a0The Daily Beast.Milo, Tech, Donald Trump, Lucian WintrichComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He appeared at a closed hearing in federal court in Baltimore on Aug. 29 and has been in government custody since, according to court records.During a court-ordered search of Martin\u2019s home, the FBI \u201cseized thousands of pages of documents and dozens of computers or other digital storage devices and media,\u201d prosecutor Zachary Myers said in a court filing made public Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe digital media contained many terabytes of information that must be reviewed by appropriate authorities.\u201d\u201cWhen Booz Allen learned of the arrest of one of its employees by the FBI, we immediately reached out to the authorities to offer our total cooperation in their investigation, and we fired the employee,\u201d the company wasted no time in declaring. \u201cWe continue to cooperate fully with the government on its investigation into this serious matter. There have been no material changes to our client engagements as a result of this matter. Booz Allen is a 102-year-old company, and the alleged conduct does not reflect our core values.\u201dThe\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0quotes U.S. officials who said Martin was \u201choarding\u201d classified materials \u201cgoing back as far as a decade in his house and car, and the recent leak of the hacking tools tipped investigators to what he was doing.\u201dAccording to these sources, some of the documents found at his home \u201ccould be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States.\u201dThe \u201chacking tools\u201d referenced in the\u00a0Post\u00a0story are the cyber-weapons put up for auction by a group calling itself the \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d in August. These wares were purportedly the best hacks from the NSA\u2019s Equation Group, and a number of observers at the time said they looked like the real deal. NBC News reports some of the hacking code in Martin\u2019s possession was the same as the material offered by the Shadow Brokers.It would appear investigators were able to track Martin down as the source of this leak very quickly. (Or, as the Politico report suggests, the timeline of Martin\u2019s arrest might make it difficult to connect him to the Shadow Brokers.)The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0calls Martin\u2019s arrest \u201canother humiliating lapse for both Booz Allen and the NSA,\u201d following Snowden absconding with a vast trove of sensitive documents. The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0cites officials attempting to defend the administration by pointing out many of the documents taken by Martin were evidently taken before the Snowden story broke, and new security measures were put in place.Politico suggests the delay in publicly announcing Martin\u2019s arrest and initial court appearance could mean he is cooperating with the government. He has voluntarily waived his right to be indicted or released within 30 days, giving prosecutors until March 1st to prepare an indictment.Prosecutors appear to be working on a plea-bargain deal, telling the court that trying Martin would be difficult because defense lawyers would not have the security clearances necessary to review the evidence. The sensitive nature of the evidence is also why it is so difficult for the public to be told the extent of the damage he might have caused to national security.\u201cAt this point, these are mere allegations. There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country.\u00a0What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served our nation honorably in the United States Navy, and he has devoted his entire career to serving and protecting America,\u201d said the defense lawyers in question, Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman.However, FBI agents noted Martin falsely denied taking the sensitive documents found in his home and car, then later admitted he knew taking them was wrong.NBC News noticed Snowden weighing in on the Martin arrest:This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products? https://t.co/otgOwB5efm\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) October 5, 2016In other words, he thinks Martin might have been the source for media reports that the NSA knew about critical security flaws in various software products, but kept its knowledge secret \u2014 putting consumers, businesses, and other government entities at risk \u2014 because the NSA wanted to exploit those flaws for its own intelligence-gathering purposes.Interestingly, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0notes that among the \u201cmany terabytes of information\u201d found in Martin\u2019s possession were documents produced in 2014, which is when some major stories accusing the NSA of knowing about critical commercial security flaws were published, concurrent with the public\u2019s discovery of the Heartbleed bug.Big Government, National Security, Tech, Edward Snowden, FBI, hackers, justice department, NSA, Shadow BrokersComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

I can\u2019t believe that in 2016 leftists are still appropriating bomb culture from the Religion of Peace. I\u2019m so offended!You\u2019re in for a special treat this evening, because I am going to speak to you about my most popular topic, feminism.First, some celebratory news. It\u2019s a bad day for feminists: first, hand-wringer in chief Hillary Clinton just had another 2,050 emails dropped. Not the mysterious tranche we\u2019re waiting for from her server, \u00a0but those of her campaign manager John Podesta.The emails reveal that Clinton\u2019s campaign deliberately portrayed Bernie Sanders supporters as misogynistic \u201cBerniebros\u201d and Sanders himself as a sexist with \u201cextreme views\u201d on women.Another victory I just heard about before coming on stage: the University of Alabama was just forced to climb down after demanding that the College Republicans over there pay $8,000 to have me speak. It\u2019s a new way colleges are trying to shut down speakers they don\u2019t like.Well, guys. The only person at risk at a Milo talk is me. And I bring my own security. And it\u2019s illegal for you to charge students these exorbitant fees. The university has now confirmed that its students will be charged a grand total of zero to have me attend.Anyway. To this evening\u2019s main event \u2013 feminism.\u00a0I get a lot of emails on this subject. Their message is simple.The message is \u201cThank you.\u201d Thank you for standing up for me, and for boys who have no voice. \u00a0Thank you for reminding me that my life has a purpose, and is what I make of it, not what feminists tell me.Thank you for speaking up against power. \u00a0Because feminism is the power now, in many ways. \u00a0Hillary Clinton is running for president on the back of racism against whites and sexism against men, touting the mythical gender gap we all know so well.Nowhere is this power greater than on American campuses. The good news is we see widening cracks in that power, with every rape hoax that is exposed, and with every alumnus that withdraws his funding after another asinine stunt and the requisite caving of administrations to show they are good feminists too.That constant stream of letters from young men galvanized me to action, resulting in this tour and the privilege to speak directly to students.Interestingly, there is a second type of email I get, not as frequently as the first but still quite regularly. These letters are from women, also saying thank you.You can tell a woman\u2019s fan letter to me because they are typically caveated with all the hurtful things I say that they don\u2019t like\u2026 for example \u201cDear Milo you are completely wrong on trannies they are girls if they want to be\u2026.. But I must write to say thank you for standing up to feminist idiots.\u201dIt used to surprise me that women would write to me for speaking out on behalf of men, but it helped me realize there are women just as much against third-wave feminism as I am.One of my most popular catchphrases is \u201cFeminism is Cancer\u201d. \u00a0No matter how you look at it, Feminism is Cancer. Some of you might call me radiation therapy. \u00a0But the analogy is bad. \u00a0Radiation therapy damages normal tissue in a desperate attempt to kill cancer.But my humor, facts, and charming personality are harmless to normal people. \u00a0Only feminists, their Muslim buddies and black lives matter suffer from post traumatic stress disorder when I speak.Rich people that get cancer will seek out the experts at the Mayo Clinic. You\u2019ve all been referred to the experts on feminism, the MILO clinic. I know you thought it would treat STDs but you\u2019re wrong!The good news is that everyone in this room and everyone watching online are also the chemotherapy that America needs.Radical feminism of course started in academia. Some would assume it is a type of brain cancer. \u00a0But I\u2019ve seen enough of universities to know we can conclusively say feminism is a bowel cancer.American college campuses have gone to shit.Smoking can take decades to give smokers lung cancer. \u00a0But college can give women the cancer of feminism as early as their first semester. \u00a0Why aren\u2019t there warning labels on college? \u00a0Warning: College may turn you into an extremely unloveable woman. \u00a0Warning: College may ensure cats are your only close companions. \u00a0Warning: College may quadruple your body piercings and quintuple your BMI.Speaking of smoking, have you noticed America\u2019s nanny state never controls the really unhealthy behaviors that plague our culture? \u00a0They will ban large sodas, but not put a waiting period on blue hair dye. \u00a0They check ID for alcohol purchases if you look younger than 35, but do they weigh feminists before serving them venti frappuchinos? No.Some cancer sufferers smoke medicinal marijuana to help with their appetite. \u00a0Feminists, of course, don\u2019t need any help with their appetite.What I will speak to you about tonight is WHY feminism is cancer, how it has metastasized on college campuses, and what sort of effect feminism has had on young men, who have had the dubious distinction of being the first generation to be schooled at feminist universities.But if we stopped there, we would tell only half the story. \u00a0Because as negative as radical feminism is for men, it is worse for women.Let\u2019s start with men.Men have always borne the brunt of the risk in romantic relationships. You\u2019re the ones expected to make the first move, make the judgements about whether it\u2019s a good time to approach, work out how to ask her out, and then wait with their self-esteem on the line while she makes a decision.Men have accepted this burden without complaint, because they see it as part of being a man. Somehow, I expect that feminists would see it as a great injustice if they were the ones saddled with this task. But men aren\u2019t whiners, so they put up with the double standards, and have done for years.Amazingly, yet predictably, feminists aren\u2019t satisfied that the scales are already tilted in women\u2019s favor. They want complete control over romantic relationships.It\u2019s not enough that they can destroy a man\u2019s self esteem with a word of rejection. They also want to throw men in jail if their advance is too awkward, or if they themselves say yes and later regret it.Complete control. That\u2019s the impulse behind feminist attempts to expand the definitions of sexual assault and harassment.That\u2019s the reason we now have \u201caffirmative consent,\u201d perhaps the most kafkaesque set of laws in America.Affirmative consent, for those who don\u2019t know, is the idea that if you don\u2019t consent at every stage of a sexual encounter, it\u2019s rape. That means asking for every kiss and asking for every boob squeeze. It\u2019s almost as if feminists want everyone to remain celibate.Just because they can\u2019t get any sex, they want the rest of us to have deserts down there too.Men won\u2019t even get a fair trial. If they\u2019re accused of sexual assault on a college campus, they\u2019ll be hauled before a group of college administrators for a \u201ctribunal,\u201d in which they will be denied legal representation and face a lower standard of evidence than in a criminal court. Even if they somehow beat this rigged system, like Emma Sulkowicz\u2019s victim did, they can still have their lives ruined in the media.When men are being told that they\u2019ll be labelled \u201charassers\u201d for making an awkward advance, and \u201crapists\u201d for bad drunken sex or not getting consent for the fifth make-out session, there\u2019s only one logical course of action: retreat.The rise of feminism has fatally coincided with the rise of video games, internet porn, and, sometime in the near future, sex robots. With all these options available, and the growing perils of real-world relationships, men are simply walking away.In 2015, I wrote an article on this trend, which I call the \u201csexodus.\u201d It was an astonishing success, and was read and shared millions of times. Clearly the idea resonated with a lot of men growing up in a modern, feminist society.Men who retreat aren\u2019t necessarily the biggest victims here. They can function without real-world relationships much better than women. The real catastrophe is what it\u2019s doing to society as a whole.Birth rates are collapsing. If you took away immigrant communities, who tend to have higher birth rates, many western countries would have birth rates approximating those of Japan.Of course, beyond the sexodus, feminism is also affecting birth rates by producing the pathetic, unloveable creature known as the \u201cmale feminist.\u201d You\u2019re unlikely to get laid if you\u2019re part of the sexodus, sure, but celibacy is practically guaranteed as a male feminist. These beta orbiting cucks proudly carry the feminist banner, but they look at the cause as their best hope to get laid. Why do you think so many male feminists turn out to be virgins, perverts or, even more often, both?There is another aspect of feminism that is very negative for men, but I will only briefly touch on it because most of the men in this room are young and therefore consider themselves invincible.If you get cancer as you age, the medical establishment\u2019s kowtowing to feminism will likely hurt your chances of surviving.Women\u2019s cancers like breast and ovarian cancer are widely publicized, you can\u2019t go anywhere without those pink ribbons being in your face.A Breitbart analysis of stories on NPR\u2019s website showed there are 2.8 times as many stories on women\u2019s cancers as men\u2019s.But the lack of publicity won\u2019t kill you. Men are used to toiling away in thankless jobs. It is the lack of research dollars.Breast cancer and prostate cancer affect a similar number of women and men respectively, and kill a similar number of their sufferers each year. But breast cancer receives more than double the research funding of prostate cancer, for no other reason than it affects women. And maybe because it involves tits.In other words, not only is feminism cancer \u2014 it\u2019s making other cancers worse!That is a REAL gender gap.Cancer patients receive chemo, which causes severe weight loss. Only a matter of time before it\u2019s banned as a form of fat-shaming.What do we think: compulsory chemo for all self-described third-wave feminists? Maybe that\u2019s too much to hope for. Feminists constantly beg for money, especially on social media and through kickstarter projects that never seem to be completed. \u00a0Unlike those parasites, cancer sufferers do deserve your donations. I suggest the Prostate Cancer Foundation.Now, the fact that feminism is destructive to young men isn\u2019t surprising. But what may be surprising to the average listener is the second stage of the feminist cancer: that it spreads to the very gender is claims to empower.It is easy to compare feminism\u2019s effect on women to leukemia. It often affects the young, and once it appears it quickly spreads throughout the entire bloodstream.On the other hand, whenever you see leukemia patients in commercials for charities, the kids are always so cute\u2026 Have you EVER heard of a cute feminist?Another similarity is the type of survivor left behind. When a woman is fortunate enough to beat feminism and call herself a feminism survivor, she knows she is on a road to recovery and is no longer at risk of terminal insufferability. Remission from feminism should be celebrated with loved ones just like remission from cancer.Radical feminists are perplexed and outraged when confronted with a woman that is not a feminist. With tremendous self righteousness they will hold up a dictionary and say the definition of feminism is seeking equality between the sexes.The problem for them is nobody is buying it any more. \u00a0A Vox poll in 2015 shows that only 18% of Americans consider themselves feminists. \u00a0But 85% of Americans believe in equality between the sexes.Either feminism has a serious marketing problem, or third-wave feminism has nothing to do with equality.My money is on the latter.Third-wave feminism, the only kind allowed on campus these days, replaces girl\u2019s fantasies about unicorns and fairy kingdoms with one equally as mythological: the concept of patriarchy.Feminists live in a grim, terrible world where an evil and powerful patriarchy controls a woman\u2019s every move and holds them down in low paying jobs. Feminism has created a world in which men are the enemy of women.In this dystopian world, women and girls are weak and incapable of making it on their own without the help of the sisterhood and whatever pathetic beta orbiters can be roped in to repeat their conspiracy theories and lies.In the odd, fake, world feminists live in, the patriarchy says to women \u201cyou are nothing without us,\u201d \u00a0but in the real world it is feminists saying to women \u201cYou are nothing without us.\u201dFrom my viewpoint, modern feminists WANT you to be weak, WANT you to be in unsuccessful relationships with men, and WANT you to be uneducated. \u00a0They will happily fill women\u2019s heads with drivel in a gender studies course, but that isn\u2019t an education.Gender studies graduates emerge from university dumber than when they started school, believing more untrue things and dramatically less able to function in the real world.Many feminists on this campus are no doubt scrambling to get into their safe spaces now that I\u2019m here. \u00a0We rightly mock safe spaces, because we know part of college is facing uncomfortable things, and learning to logically and rationally confront ideas you don\u2019t like.Fragile feminists think safe spaces will protect them from the world, but they don\u2019t. \u00a0In fact safe spaces grant the rest of the world a brief reprieve from dealing with left-wing stupidity, which is the only real argument for them. \u00a0But the real result of a safe space is to reinforce ignorance, fragility, and a toddler mentality. It\u2019s therapy culture.Some of you may be asking: if feminism is a low percentage of the American population, how can it hurt women?\nWell, cancer is also a low percentage of its sufferer\u2019s cells, but it still damages the entire body by spreading to vital organs. A low percentage of Americans may be feminists, but feminism has spread into the most vital sectors of American life: academia, media, and politics.And this has potentially deadly consequences.Feminism pushes for women in combat, because to feminists, women can do everything men can do, better.This is of course a lie. And when some of the jobs are really serious, like, say, defending our nation, it becomes a very dangerous lie.Beyond the physical differences in strength and coordination between men and women, there are deeper issues. A study from the Marine Corps last year found that all-male units performed better than mixed units in 69 per cent of tasks.What did the Army learn when contemplating the madness of women in combat? \u201cFemale soldiers suffered double the rate of injuries compared with male colleagues in Army combat training, including jobs in field artillery and repairing the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.\u201dWhat did the Marines discover? \u201cWithin the research at the Infantry Training Battalion, females undergoing that entry-level training were injured at more than six-times the rate of their male counterparts.\u201dWomen in the army don\u2019t want combat roles. Only 8% of female troops surveyed want a combat role.But the military still pushed forward, to avoid a feminist backlash. \u00a0And they did so by lowering standards. \u00a0Lowering standards doesn\u2019t just affect America\u2019s ability to win wars. Lowering standards in the military gets people killed, including, and disproportionately, women.If they don\u2019t get you killed on the job, Feminists will affect your career by creating an adverse relationship in the workplace between men and women.It used to be considered good advice for celebrities and athletes to keep witnesses around in case they are charged with sexual misconduct by a woman looking for a payday. Now it\u2019s sound advice for every man, including your bosses and professors.Even if you do get a good job, feminists may get you laid off so that your employer can look like a good corporate citizen. Intel invested $300 million in diversity efforts, which is another way of saying they spent $300 million on nothing. \u00a0What you may not know is shortly after that initiative, they announced $300 million in cuts across business units. Hello looking good to feminists, goodbye jobs for men and women in research and development.Almost every effort to control speech and shut down either \u201cabusive speech\u201d or \u201chate speech\u201d, terms that mean absolutely anything a person wants them to, is a feminist project.About 1 year ago, the United Nations suggested we censor the entire Internet to save feminist\u2019s feelings.They released a completely insane report called \u201cCyber Violence Against Women And Girls: A Global Wake-up Call\u201d.Now, if I was writing a report on \u201ccyberviolence,\u201d I could do it in 140 characters, but someone infinitely more gifted already has.The UN report itself contains a number of bizarre attempts to equate critical tweets on the internet with physical violence.\u201cA cyber-touch is recognised as equally as harmful as a physical touch\u201d says the report. In their press release, UN Women claim that \u201ccyber violence \u2026 places a premium on emotional bandwidth.\u201dWhatever the fuck \u201cemotional bandwidth\u201d is.The UN isn\u2019t so worried about women being raped and harassed in Europe, or discriminated against in the Middle East. If they did they wouldn\u2019t have put Saudi Arabia on their human rights committee.They care that people criticize feminists on the Internet. Think about that for a while.Beyond the UN, look at Twitter and their trust and safety council. \u00a0They basically killed Twitter by embracing the nonsense idea of \u201conline harassment.\u201d Naturally, their death became obvious once they banned their most fabulous and entertaining user.\u00a0Feminism does a terrible job picking causes\u2026.. And icons. I think they need a man\u2019s touch in this area.Think about high profile feminist heroes:Why does feminism always select this type of charlatan to be their heroes? \u00a0Why not find successful women that don\u2019t exist to enhance the appearance of perpetual victimhood? \u00a0You do the math.The sight of Hillary suppressing a seizure is nothing compared to the sight of a feminist when told that some women want to be stay at home moms.Feminists aren\u2019t for women\u2019s choice, they are for women doing exactly what they are told to do by feminists. \u00a0It is a very communist set of ideals, which is why you see a big crossover between feminism and Marxism.Hillary Clinton in her delightful speech on the Alt-Right was kind enough to read out some of my headlines.My favorite one is \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.\u201dSorry, no offense, but it\u2019s true. Women have been far unhappier over the last 35 years.This corresponds to the feminist message: where self-medication, childlessness, and slaving away in a cubicle are touted as the path to utopia.Even beyond your chosen lifestyle, feminism will affect your life.Consider marriage. \u00a0Pew Research has found a REAL gender gap, but this one is about attitudes about marriage in young people. Comparing data from 1997 and 2012, Pew finds a big split has developed. \u00a0While the percentages used to be similar, now interest among young men has dropped considerably while the interest among young women has risen considerably.This is the natural result of feminism, young men are witnessing the financial horror of divorce for men, along with the unfairness of child custody. They are seeing feminists and assuming their potential spouse might be like those awful harpies.Most women aren\u2019t, but they are suffering thanks to the negative stereotypes of women put about by feminism. \u00a0Women on the other hand are having trouble finding men interested in marriage or relationship, making them desire a suitable man more.And we know women always want what they can\u2019t have. It explains why I have so many female fans.Feminists on campus will try to fill your head with garbage. One example is their rape on campus stats, are they up to 4 out of 5 girls will be raped? \u00a0They always change the stat! It\u2019s always garbage.Feminists on campus will talk your ear off about the wage gap. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t how many economists show that the wage gap is a result of choices made. \u00a0America is the most free society for women on earth. \u00a0Women are free to study what they want, and they naturally gravitate towards majors that suit them.Some of these are high paying, like nursing and occupational therapy, both of which are more than 85% female. \u00a0\u00a0But most are not. \u00a0Elementary Education and social work have similar percentages of female students, but much lower pay.Men on the other hand dominate high paying STEM majors like Electrical Engineering. \u00a0Women are free to study engineering, and often make fine engineers.But why on earth would feminism feel the need to shoehorn women into studying a subject they don\u2019t want to? The movement that claimed to be about female empowerment now seems to be about female conformity.You\u2019re probably quite depressed by now.Don\u2019t be.Together, we are winning the war against feminism. We are publicizing their tricks on campus and off, exposing their lies, and proving that women don\u2019t need shrill harpies calling them weak victims of a made up patriarchy.I greatly admire the young people who have to fight feminism in the trenches of academia, as opposed to from a giant tour bus with their face on the side.Keep resisting, keep pointing out the facts, and keep laughing. Together, with facts and laughter, we can fight off this disease.

Both of the gangs whose members were at The Crust the night of the shooting are identified as gangs in multiple court documents available at the Williamsburg James City Courthouse.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

According to a Pew Research poll, 91% of Americans feel as if they have lost control over how their data is used and processed by companies. In a statement released on their website, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler argued that \u201cin today\u2019s digital world, consumers deserve to be able to make informed choices about their privacy\u2026 online.\u201d\u201cFCC regulations limit how your phone company can repurpose and resell what it learns about your phone activity without your consent. Similar rules don\u2019t exist for broadband service today,\u201d Wheeler continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a gap that must be closed \u2013 consumers who use the network of the 21st century deserve similar protections.\u201dUnder the proposal, ISPs must get permission from consumers before broadband providers can use or share the vast majority of their data, such as GPS locations, email content, financial information, and browser history.Such data is currently free to access, and could net ISPs a huge profit by selling it\u00a0to advertisers. Currently, Verizon is estimated to spend around $4.8 billion on purchasing Yahoo after acquiring AOL last year for $4.4 billion in order to form an advertising business.Initially proposed in March, the FCC have toned down the strength of the regulation. Originally, \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d data such as names and addresses would also need prior approval to be passed on, but after complaints from ISPs, this is no longer required. Agency officials have said that the \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d data privileges can still be revoked by the customer.This backtrack came after ISPs claimed\u00a0that such a move would leave them in an unfair position when compared to websites such as Google and Facebook. Mobile phone apps and websites would not have to abide by the proposal, as they come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, not the FCC. However, Wheeler noted that websites owned by the broadband providers would also be exempt.Overall, the plan has had positive feedback from pro-privacy pressure groups.

The hacking claim Friday was another setback in already strained U.S.-Russia relations.The White House declined to say whether the formal attribution would trigger sanctions against Russia. A senior Obama administration official said the U.S. would respond \u201cat a time and place of our choosing,\u201d but any retaliation may not take place in the open.The official said the public won\u2019t necessarily know what actions the U.S. has already taken or will take in the future against Russia in cyberspace. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity.Federal officials are investigating cyberattacks at the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Election data systems in at least two states also have been breached.\u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\u201d the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement with the Department of Homeland Security.The statement said recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on websites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks, and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona, are consistent with the methods and motivations of efforts directed by Russia, which has denied involvement.\u201cThese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSuch activity is not new to Moscow. The Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.\u201dA phone message and email left with the Embassy of the Russian Federation were not immediately returned Friday afternoon.California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House intelligence committee, applauded the administration\u2019s decision to publicly name Russia as the source of the hacking.\u201cWe should now work with our European allies who have been the victim of similar and even more malicious cyber interference by Russia to develop a concerted response that protects our institutions and deters further meddling,\u201d Schiff said.Intelligence officials say some states have experienced scanning or probing of their election systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. They stopped short, though, in attributing this activity to the Russian government. And administration officials say it would be difficult to alter the results of the election because of the decentralized nature of the American electoral process.2016 Presidential Race, National Security, Tech, Adam Schiff, DCLeaks, department of homeland security, Guccifer 2.0, Russia, WikiLeaksComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Ard is a former Yahoo employee.The suit also singles out\u00a0former chief marketing officer Kathy Savitt, according to SiliconValley.com:\u201cWhen Savitt began at Yahoo the top managers reporting to her \u2026 including the chief editors of the verticals and magazines were less than 20 percent female. Within a year and a half those top managers were more than 80 percent female,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cSavitt has publicly expressed support for increasing the number of women in media and has intentionally hired and promoted women because of their gender, while terminating, demoting or laying off male employees because of their gender.\u201cOf the approximately 16 senior-level editorial employees hired or promoted by Savitt \u2026 in approximately an 18-month period, 14 of them, or 87 percent, were female.\u201d the lawsuit said.Mayer, a former Google engineer, became a prominent symbol of female empowerment in the tech industry when she was hired as Yahoo\u2019s CEO in 2012, especially since she was pregnant when hired. Initially, she was credited with rescuing the company from a long downward spiral under several previous chief executives.

He then threatened to send any money he received from Wintrich to the Clinton campaign.Lucian Wintrich, the exhibition organizer, is a Trump supporter and creator \u00a0of \u201cTwinks For Trump,\u201d a photoseries showcasing young gay male Trump supporters. His work was featured at the \u201cGays For Trump\u201d party at this year\u2019s RNC. Wintrich\u2019s support for Trump cost him his job after he was praised in a column by Milo Yiannopoulos.Wintrich\u2019s latest pro-Trump art show is still raising funds on IndieGoGo.\u201cThis is not something that we would have shown as part of the gallery program and did not intend to support it\u201d said Amrhein.\u201cAny money that would be made by Pierogi through this exhibition will be given to the Hillary Clinton campaign, a hopefully fitting irony for this narcissist asshole.\u201dAmrhein later sent a follow-up comment stating that the event was cancelled, and publicly accusing Wintrich of \u201clying to him\u201d about the nature of the event.In text messages between Wintrich and Pierogi seen by\u00a0Breitbart,\u00a0Amrhein can be seen fretting that a pro-Trump event would cause \u201c20 years of reputation\u201d to \u201cgo down the drain\u201d even as he attempted to placate Wintrich by trying to find him a different venue.Amrhein claims to have been tricked into believing that the event was satirical, yet earlier text messages between himself and Wintrich show that he was fully aware this was a Trump-related, and anticipated the potential PR fallout.\u201cWe\u2019ll go ahead with your show but we we need to take The Boiler off the press release and advertising\u201d wrote Amrhein in a text message dated September 28th. \u201cWe also won\u2019t allow to have Trump\u2019s name appear outside the gallery on the sidewalk or street.\u201dHowever, as negative press piled up (Mic.com recently scared a gay military charity into declining funds that Wintrich planned to raise at the event), Amrhein grew more hysterical.\u201cYou lied to us. There are Alt-Right figures in the show. You lied to us!!! I don\u2019t care about the press. I guess I do care you are destroying us at our expense\u201d wrote Amrhein in a text to Wintrich this Wednesday. He then informed Wintrich that he wanted to cancel the event.The cancellation comes amid news that left-wing gay activists are planning to protest the event. Gayletter, a New York-based gay magazine, emailed a message calling for protests earlier today, and a Facebook event entitled \u201cQueer Love Against Trump\u2019s Hate\u201d calling for protests against \u201cbigotry and fascism\u201d at the event has also been set up.This is not the first art event to cause political controversy. Other famous examples include\u00a0Piss Christ,\u00a0a plastic crucifix submerged in the urine of artist Andres Serrano, which debuted in the late 1980s. That too generated protests, but left-wing supporters of the art piece defended it as an example of freedom of speech.Almost thirty years later, the tables have turned. Now it\u2019s left-wingers trying to shut down art events they find offensive, and right-wingers defending artistic freedom.You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.\u00a0Email tips and suggestions to abokhari@breitbart.com.2016 Presidential Race, Milo, Tech, Gavin McInnes, James O'Keefe, Lucian Wintrich, Martin Shkreli, Milo YiannopolousComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Unfortunately, this has only had marginal effect in stemming the tide.The\u00a0Washington State Gambling Commission isn\u2019t satisfied. As of October 5th, 2016, they have \u201cnotified Valve Corporation that it must\u00a0immediately stop allowing the transfer of virtual weapons known as \u2018skins\u2019 for gambling\u00a0activities through the company\u2019s Steam Platform.\u201dThe commission\u2019s press release recalls information from the Esports Betting Report as an example, citing the reported $1 billion that the \u201cCSGO Lounge\u201d betting site gained between January and August 2016 alone. It\u2019s a serious problem \u2014 not the least of which is due to the fact that children are especially vulnerable to a video-game based gambling system that can be easily accessed on the internet, as opposed to a restricted brick-and-mortar location in an area where such activity is legal.The problem is that this would require Valve to entirely dismantle its Counter-Strike item marketplace, which is in and of itself harmless. It allows for players to buy, sell, and trade in-game cosmetic rewards received\u00a0from crates awarded through gameplay. Washington State is attempting to force Valve to forfeit legitimate business because of exploitation that exists outside their ability to control.It\u2019s hard to see how this could result in any sort of change \u2014 it reeks of bureaucracy with limited understanding of the platform and its activities. But unless Valve does suspend its marketplace entirely, it\u2019s just as difficult to see how this problem could be addressed in any effective manner.Follow\u00a0Nate\u00a0Church\u00a0@Get2Church\u00a0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.Tech, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, valve, video gamesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0With NASA expected to conclude its research on the International Space Station before 2024, U.S. space travel and colonization has been turned over to private companies like SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic for the conquest of Mars.SpaceX CEO Elon Musk kicked off the land rush to Mars when he formally announced on September 26 at the 67th\u00a0International Astronautical Congress\u00a0in Guadalajara, Mexico, that he intends to \u201cMake Humans a Multi-planetary Species\u201d by having SpaceX launch the first leg of its privately funded two-year mission to Mars by 2022. Musk hilariously commented at the conference, \u201cI\u2019d like to die on Mars, just not on impact.\u201dMusk outlined that SpaceX\u00a0would soon unveil a powerful reusable rocket system called the Interplanetary Transport System\u00a0(ITS), which can carry a 100-person working crew to the \u201cRed Planet\u201d to set up permanent extraterrestrial colonies, factories and mines.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, speaking at an early October conference in Chicago, said his company was joining the land rush, and that he is \u201cconvinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,\u201d according to\u00a0Bloomberg.Boeing unveiled its heavy-lift rocket project, called the Space Launch System,\u00a0which\u00a0also aims to develop reusable rocket systems. Many aspects of Boeing\u2019s plan appear similar to SpaceX, but Muilenburg commented that his plan is a more realistic approach because it will rely on at least $60 billion in private sector satellite launches and NASA-funded development prior to a human-crewed venture to Mars in the late 2030s.NASA has essentially been operating as a joint venture in space travel with the Russians since the July 17, 1975 \u201crendezvous between the Soyuz and Apollo spacecrafts proved that the Soviet Union and the United States could set aside their differences in the name of advancing manned spaceflight,\u201d according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.The partnership allowed Washington to\u00a0curtail drastically its very expansive NASA budgets, which at the height of the Apollo program accounted for 4.2 percent of all federal budget spending. Today, that budget is less than one-half percent of federal spending.As NASA\u2019s budget declined, the U.S. space agency also struck partnership deals with other nations and the private sector to help finance research efforts. Although the U.S. continued to pay most of the cost of the International Space Station, the U.S. gained benefits, sharing the expenses with others.Historically, manned space flight has been mostly about basic research, and had few military applications. A few experiments could only be conducted in zero atmosphere, but there is no advantage to putting military special forces in space. Remote satellites are far superior to manned spacecraft for reconnaissance and imaging programs.But with the U.S. once again becoming a military and policy adversary on the world stage to the Russians and the Chinese, the importance of space as the ultimate high ground in terrestrial warfare is becoming more obvious, according to Stratfor.The U.S. has always banned Chinese scientists from working with their NASA counterparts because of national security concerns. The International Space Station required all participating nations to hand over technical information and make their hardware freely accessible to anyone involved in the program, a step China has refused to take.China, with the help of Russia, launched its second space lab into orbit in September as a preparatory step to a permanent space station in the 2020s. Russia has recently announced that it intends to separate their portion of the International Space Station modules in 2024, and then build their own outpost, or partner with the Chinese.China and Russia are focused on colonization and economic exploitation of the moon. Beijing plans to follow the model of its One Belt, One Road\u00a0strategy of using economic projects and partnerships to gain political support abroad, particularly in the developing world. Moscow\u2019s space strategy is focused on military projects and the projection of power.But NASA and the Obama administration are squarely focused on reaching the Red Planet, and will let private sector companies grab Mars as the ultimate resource platform.Big Government, Breitbart California, Tech, Apollo, boeing, China, Interplanetary Transport System, ITS, Multi-planetary Species, Russia, Soyuz, Space Launch System, SpaceX, stratforComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Flynn10 Oct 20160If you found yourself in the Orange Bowl on November 12 of that year, you witnessed one of the great title fights in boxing history. Aaron Pryor, Alexis Arguello, and 30,000 or so of the Nicaraguan\u2019s closest friends flowed into the football stadium for The Battle of the Champions, in the conversation for the best megafight of a decade bursting with them.Pryor came out unleashing bombs from the bell, dipping down and rising to throw haymakers. He combined two favorites of fans, volume and power, to win rounds and much of the crowd. Arguello enjoyed limited success boxing at a distance, dodging blows, and countering when the fight moved into a phone booth in rounds two and three. In the third, he briefly knocked Pryor through the ropes, which brought a showman\u2019s shimmy in response, and caught the Hawk off balance after the Cincinnatian fired a characteristically looping shot. But Pryor fought his fight effectively, and frenetically, in the bout\u2019s first half.Arguello, utilizing a jab and straight punches but stalking in an almost flat-footed manner, looked like a textbook boxer from the waist up; Pryor, utilizing footwork but relying on uppercuts and looping punches, boxed from the waist down as he brawled from the waist up. This played to Arguello\u2019s advantage in the second half of the match. He rocked the slowed and occasionally out of position WBA super lightweight champion with an uppercut in the tenth and scored a series of sensational straight rights in the eleventh. By the thirteenth, when Arguello snapped the Ohioan\u2019s head back, HBO\u2019s Barry Thompkins noted: \u201cI believe a little bit of the starch has gone out of Aaron Pryor\u2019s legs.\u201dThen, in between rounds, that starch strangely returned. \u201cGimme the other bottle,\u201d trainer Panama Lewis infamously interjected in the corner, \u201cthe one I mixed.\u201d Pryor imbibed a fountain-of-youth elixir that preceded him teeing off on Arguello against the ropes, which coaxed the referee to halt the 140-pound fight in the fourteenth.The technical knockout remains one of the most controversial in boxing history. Panama Lewis, banned from the sport about a year later for employing tactics that ran afoul of the Marquess of Queensberry\u2019s perhaps na\u00efve vision of a gentlemanly sport, calling for a mysteriously water bottle\u2014not Arguello stopped while still standing\u2014makes it so. What did it contain? Peppermint Schnapps? Cocaine? Antihistamine? We don\u2019t know. We know only that Pryor came out for the fourteenth round as though the first.Sugar Ray Leonard observed live on the HBO broadcast, \u201cI don\u2019t know where he got the energy from.\u201d Many of Arguello\u2019s partisans believed they knew precisely where it came from. The undefeated pugilist quelled the controversy somewhat with his knockout of Arguello in a return engagement the next year in Las Vegas. But the bottle, like the boxer, remains the stuff of legend.E.T., \u201cEye of the Tiger,\u201d Atari, and Aaron Pryor were really big in \u201982. Unfortunately, cocaine was really big in \u201982, too. No man could take the Hawk\u2019s title\u2019s from him. But coke eventually did.Too bad for boxing. Bouts with Ray Mancini, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, and other cash cows never materialized in part because the bout with addiction (and the usual bad boxing mathematics), one which Pryor eventually won, did. But the classic fight with an 83-5 Nicaraguan materialized. And for that, boxing fans offer gratitude.Like Alexis Arguello and 15-round title fights, Aaron Pryor is gone. The Hawk left us for good this weekend after a battle with heart disease. But Pryor, like so much else big in \u201982, lives on forever on YouTube.\nBreitbart Sports, Aaron Pryor, Alexis ArguelloComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

West Virginia 4-0 [Bye, Last Week #22]\u2014Out of off weeks, the Mountaineers enter the meat of their schedule.22. Western Michigan 6-0 [Defeated Northern Illinois, Last Week #21]\u2014I like Western Michigan, but they do not deserve to move up after defeating a one-win MAC opponent.21. Auburn 4-2 [Defeated Mississippi State, Last Week NR]\u2014For the first time in a long time, the Auburn football program enjoys some momentum behind it. Now, it needs to make the most of the next two weeks as they prepare for Arkansas.20. Utah 5-1 [Defeated Arizona, Last Week #25]\u2014It is a rough year for the PAC 12, but the Utes still have plenty to play for.19. Florida 4-1 [Game Postponed/Cancelled, Last Week #18]\u2014Florida deserves to drop a spot for the debacle over the LSU game.18. Miami 4-1 [Lost to Florida State, Last Week #11]\u2014It was a heart-breaking loss to FSU, but there is still plenty to play for in Mark Richt\u2019s first season.17. Florida State 4-2 [Defeated Miami, Last Week NR]\u2014I am probably being too forgiving with the Seminoles, but this is a team with the talent to really jump off after the surprising win over Miami.16. Boise State 5-0 [Defeated New Mexico, Last Week #19]\u2014The Broncos continue to roll without a team on the schedule that, on the surface, looks like a potential threat.15. Virginia Tech 4-1 [Defeated North Carolina, Last Week #24]\u2014At the beginning of the season, I thought the Hokies and their quarterback Jerod Evans would be among the season\u2019s surprises. Despite the loss against Tennessee, this team still can be a factor this year.14. Oklahoma 3-2 [Defeated Texas, Last Week #16]\u2014It says a lot (or a little) about the strength of the programs outside of the top 10 that the Sooners are a top-15 team given their lack of strong showing this season.13. Nebraska 5-0 [Bye, Last Week #14]\u2014Now rested up, Mike Riley\u2019s team still has visits to Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Iowa on its schedule.12. Ole Miss 3-2 [Bye, Last Week #13]\u2014After a bye week, the Rebels enter a season-defining stretch at Arkansas, at LSU, and against Auburn. It is a long shot, but this team still has a sliver of hope to make the playoff.11. Baylor 5-0 [Bye, Last Week #12]\u2014IF the Bears remain undefeated, will anyone care? I tend to think a one- or even two-loss champion from the other Power 5 conferences might get preference given the abysmal state of the Big 12.10. Tennessee 5-1[Lost to TAMU, Last Week #9]\u2014I don\u2019t know about you, but I was getting a little tired of the Vols waiting until the fourth quarter to start playing winning football. This team has a chance to get back in the playoff picture against Alabama this week.9. Wisconsin 4-1 [Bye, Last Week #9]\u2014Only Tennessee may have a stronger ability as a one loss team to make a run to the playoff. The Badgers took a week off after a narrow loss on the road to elite Michigan and get three big games to re-emerge in the playoff hunt.8. Houston 5-1 [Lost to Navy, Last Week #4]\u2014It now appears clear that the College Football Playoff will be a purely Power 5 affair. Do not be surprised to see Houston leapfrogged here if bigger conference teams ranked lower make a run.7. Louisville 4-1 [Bye, Last Week #7]\u2014Finally, a week in which Lamar Jackson failed to put up mega stats. Of course, that\u2019s only because he wasn\u2019t playing. The Cardinals still have a shot at the playoff.6. Texas A&M 6-0 [Defeated Tennessee, Last Week #8]\u2014College football breathed a sigh of relief when the Vold\u2014who seem to abhor the idea of having a lead\u2014fell to the Aggies. While the victory was not overly impressive, Kevin Sumlin has two weeks to get his team ready for a visit to Tuscaloosa.5. Washington 6-0 [Defeated Oregon, Last Week #6]\u2014Chris Petersen has the Huskies in control of their own playoff destiny after completely thrashing Oregon.4. Michigan 6-0 [Defeated Rutgers, Last Week #5]\u2014The Wolverines head into a midseason bye week after absolutely annihilating lowly Rutgers. Harbaugh has the revival well under way in Ann Arbor.3. Clemson 6-0 [Defeated Boston College, Last Week #3]\u2014We finally saw the kind of margin of victory we expect from the Tigers. Still, Michigan and Washington both have an argument to be ranked higher than last year\u2019s #2 finisher.2. Ohio State 5-0 [Defeated Indiana, Last Week #2]\u2014Ohio State managed to defeat a much improved Indiana squad. The first direct comparison against Michigan comes in this week\u2019s matchup at Wisconsin.1. Alabama 6-0 [Defeated Arkansas, Last Week: #1]\u2014Victory was never in doubt against Arkansas, but, while this team still looks good, I am no longer convinced the Tide are head and shoulders above everyone else. Tennessee and Texas A&M are next.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

If that is the case, this week will be a good litmus test because of the number of excellent matchups, including Atlanta at Denver, Houston at Minnesota, New York Giants at Green Bay, Cincinnati at Dallas, and Tom Brady\u2019s return to action in ClevelandLet\u2019s take a closer look at Sunday\u2019s action.Washington Redskins (2-2) at Baltimore Ravens (3-1)Washington\u2019s defense is struggling, and not just because of the Iran deal. The Redskins allowed Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Cody Kessler to complete 67 percent on third down last week.Baltimore is coming off their first loss of the season at the hands of Oakland, a game in which their vaunted pass rush registered no sacks.The battle of the beltway could go either way.Atlanta Falcons (3-1) at Denver Broncos (4-0)Exciting matchup on paper featuring the NFL\u2019s top offense (Atlanta) against the league\u2019s best defense (Denver).The Falcons average 478 yards and 38 points per game, but haven\u2019t faced a defense any where near this caliber.With starter Trevor Siemian nursing a shoulder injury, the Broncos will start rookie Paxton Lynch.This game is a toss-up.Houston Texans (3-1) at Minnesota Vikings (4-0)The injuries keep piling up in Minnesota, but they continue to find ways to win.They already lost their quarterback (Teddy Bridgewater), star running back (Adrian Peterson), and left tackle (Matt Kalil) for the season. This week they will be without right tackle Andre Smith and an emerging star at receiver, Stefon Diggs.Perhaps this is the week all these injuries take their toll on the resilient Vikings.Tennessee Titans (1-3) at Miami Dolphins (1-3)People are quick to criticize Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill for his pedestrian play this year, but it would help if the Dolphins protected him better. The fourth-year signal-caller has been sacked 11 times in four games.\u201cI think we can do a better job of actually blocking people,\u201d said Dolphins coach Adam Gase.Getting franchise left tackle Brandon Albert back from an injury will help.The Titans 27th-ranked offense doesn\u2019t scare many teams.The Dolphins at home should figure out a way to win.New England Patriots (3-1) at Cleveland Browns (0-4)Patriots QB Tom Brady returns from a four-game suspension, but don\u2019t expect his usual dominating self from the get-go, according to his coach.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for a player not playing football to practice playing football,\u201d said Patriots coach Bill Belichick.But even as Brady works out the kinks, the Patriots still should have little trouble beating the beat-up, rebuilding Browns.Cincinnati Bengals (2-2) at Dallas Cowboys (3-1)While rookie quarterback Dak Prescott has done a solid job helping Dallas to a 3-1 start, he hasn\u2019t faced a defense as good as this.A big help for Prescott the last couple of games has been the work of fellow rookie, tailback Ezekial Elliott, running behind a great offensive line.Bengals cornerback Adam Jones joked Elliott hits holes so big \u201cmy little girl could run through them.\u201dDon\u2019t expect that to be the case this week against the Bengals talented front seven, and don\u2019t be surprised if the road team wins this game.New York Giants (2-2) at Green Bay Packers (2-1)The Packers are fresh coming off a bye week.The Giants are coming off a short week following a Monday Night Football road game, and have a ton of injuries in their secondary, which is far from ideal facing Aaron Rodgers.All signs point to the Packers in this game.Philadelphia Eagles (3-0) at Detroit Lions (1-3)The Eagles are 3-0 and healthy coming off a bye-week.The Lions have lost three in a row and have major injuries problems.But all the Lions losses have been very close games.The game could go either way.Buffalo Bills (2-2) at Los Angeles Rams (3-1)The Rams are one of the NFL\u2019s surprise teams, getting off to a 3-1 start.And this with their star tailback Todd Gurley struggling.A big reason for their success is a stout defense led by coordinator Gregg Williams, one of the game\u2019s best.The Rams defense, along with game-managing QB Case Keenum, should spearhead a win over visiting Buffalo.San Diego Chargers (1-3) at Oakland Raiders (3-1)The NFL season is only a month old, and the Chargers already have 15 players on injured reserve.One bit of good news on the injury front is that first-round pick, end Joey Bosa, will make his debut after battling a hamstring injury.While the Raiders look like the clear favorite in this game, it\u2019s always a mistake to count out the Chargers led by their indomitable QB Philip Rivers.New York Jets (1-3) at Pittsburgh Steelers (3-1)Two weeks ago the Steelers were blown out by the Philadelphia Eagles. Last week, they blew out Kansas City.What was the big difference in the two games?\u201cLe\u2019veon Bell,\u201d said Steelers coach Mike Tomlin.Bell, a gifted tailback who was suspended for the season\u2019s first three games, accounted for almost 200 yards of offense in his return last week. He\u2019s not just a superb runner, but an outstanding receiver.The Jets are a mess right now. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick has thrown nine interceptions in the last two games, and their pass defense is one of the NFL\u2019s worst.The obvious pick in this game are the Steelers, but don\u2019t be shocked if the Jets keep it close. They play better on the road and are desperate.Chicago Bears (1-3) at the Indianapolis Colts (1-3)The Colts defense has been awful this year. Why?\u201cWhen you pay (quarterback) Andrew (Luck) what we did, it\u2019s going to take some time to build on the other side of the ball,\u201d said Colts GM Ryan GrigsonEven with their defensive issues, the Colts should figure out a way to beat the pedestrian Bears.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

We don\u2019t have the big contracts or any of that stuff,\u201d second baseman Jason Kipnis said. \u201cBut we have 25 guys who love to compete and have bought into this team. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got.\u201dAs the for the Red Sox, David Ortiz and his teammates are in serious trouble and have to hope they can get things turned around Sunday in Game 3 at Fenway Park or their turnaround season will be over and Big Papi\u2019s career will be done.\u201cBacks against the wall,\u201d manager John Farrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear what lies ahead of us. We go home down 0-2. (Clay) Buchholz on the mound Sunday with an attitude of no tomorrow.\u201dChisenhall connected in the second inning off Price, who fell to 0-8 in nine playoff starts and must now face the wrath of Red Sox Nation. The left-hander lasted just 3 1/3 innings and once again crumbled with a chance to silence critics who say he can\u2019t pitch in the big game.Despite the loss, a defiant Price is convinced he\u2019ll get another chance.\u201cI know my number is going to be called again to pitch another game in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cI want it. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201dThe Indians strung together four straight hits \u2014 three of them soft singles \u2014 to Price in a 4-0 hole after just two innings.That\u2019s all Kluber needed. The Cy Young candidate, who hadn\u2019t pitched since straining his quadriceps on Sept. 26, had little issues with the Red Sox, who missed a chance to do some damage against him in the fourth.Kluber created the jam with two walks before getting Ortiz to swing at the first pitch and pop out. Ortiz slammed his bat to the ground in frustration and Boston\u2019s anxiety grew when Kluber struck out Hanley Ramirez looking for the final out.\u201cWe talked before the game about would he be a little bit rusty or would he be really good,\u201d Indians manager Terry Francona said. \u201cHe answered that question. He was terrific. You go through that lineup and don\u2019t give up runs, you\u2019re pitching.\u201dChisenhall\u2019s start was somewhat of a surprise since he batted just .217 against lefties this season.Francona, however, likes to put his best defense behind Kluber, plus Chisenhall came in batting .364 in his career against Price. The decision paid off in a big way early as Chisenhall\u2019s liner to right in the second gave the Indians a 4-0 lead.As he neared first, Chisenhall raised his arms in triumph. The rest is a blur.\u201cI don\u2019t remember too much running around the bases,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember seeing it go out and I knew it was a home run, so I slowed down pretty quickly. It was a quick run around the bases.\u201dBefore the Indians took the field, James, who led the Cavaliers to the city\u2019s first pro sports championship since 1964 in June, spoke to the crowd.\u201cIt\u2019s always us against the world,\u201d James said.Right now, Cleveland\u2019s on top.BEANTOWN BOUNDIf anyone knows what awaits the Indians, it\u2019s Mike Napoli, who played three seasons in Boston, winning a World Series in 2013.\u201cWe can\u2019t let off the pedal with their type of lineup and their fans,\u201d Napoli said. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to play there. It\u2019s going to be a crazy atmosphere. We need to stick together and keep playing like we know how to.\u201dTRIBE TIDBITSThe Indians have taken a 2-0 lead in the postseason four times. They are 2-1 with the only loss to Boston in the ALDS. \u2026 It was Cleveland\u2019s first postseason shutout since Game 1 of the 2001 ALDS against Seattle. \u2026 Kluber joined Gene Bearden (1948 World Series Game 3) as the only Cleveland pitchers to throw at least seven shutout innings in their postseason debut.UP NEXTRed Sox: Buchholz has had interesting season. He had a 6.35 ERA in his first 10 starts and was demoted to the bullpen. He has tweaked his mechanics and strengthened Farrell\u2019s trust by pitching six innings of one-hit ball in his last regular-season start.Indians: Josh Tomlin lost to the Red Sox on Aug. 15, allowing three runs in 7 2-3 innings.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Firstly, ratings have been tumbling week over week and now another metric to measure the effect has appeared as TV networks have now been forced to begin giving money back to advertisers because not as many people are watching football to be exposed to their TV commercials.The networks have been providing advertisers with what are termed \u201cmake-goods.\u201d These are refunds given to advertisers because the cost of advertising is predicated on the number of viewers a TV commercial will reach during a pro football game. But with ratings falling, often by double digits, advertisers are demanding their \u201cmake-goods\u201d because ads are hitting far fewer eyes than they paid for.Some are already calling these make-goods the \u201cKaepernick effect\u201d\u00a0with advertising revenues taking a major hit as fans tune out in droves.According to Sporting News, TV ads during pro football games can cost between $500,000 and $600,000 per 30-second spot. But advertisers are sold on these exorbitant costs on the assumption that their ads will be included in games reaching far above a 20 Neilsen TV rating.Unfortunately for advertisers, the networks and the NFL, ratings have tumbled to less than a 15 rating and in the case of the September 26 broadcast of Monday Night Football the game only earned a 5.7 rating. The latter was a 38 percent drop over the same week\u2019s game in 2015.This means millions of people are no longer being reached by the commercials advertisers are paying up to $600,000 to air.Meanwhile, a new Rasmussen poll finds that 32 percent of adults surveyed say that they have stopped watching NFL football because of the protests while only a scant 13 percent said they are more likely to tune in because of the anthem protests.The poll further found\u00a0that more women than men are tired of the Black Lives Matter-like protests with 29 percent of men saying they are less likely to watch pro football compared to 38 percent of women who intimated that they are uncomfortable with the protests.There is plenty of blame to go around, it appears. Sports commentator Jason Whitlock, for one, is laying some of the blame on the left-wingers infesting the sports media complex for pushing lefty causes at the expense of sports..@WhitlockJason blames progressive sports media for undermining interest in sports and the NFL rating decline. pic.twitter.com/XqAcqYEOq9\u2014 Speak For Yourself (@SFY) October 5, 2016At least one other factor has been affecting viewership on the broadcast networks. Neither Peyton Manning (retired) nor Tom Brady (suspended) played during the league\u2019s first four weeks. The NFL has been increasing its presence online and the number of people watching games over Internet services are having a thus far undetermined affect on TV viewing.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Breitbart Sports, Colin Kaepernick, NFLComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The angry white male Trump voter wants his country back. The angry white male Trump voter, to use their lunatic candidate\u2019s meaningless phrases, wants to \u2018win.\u2019 And to \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019Enough.The angry white male Trump voters are not the only angry Americans right now, in fact they are not alone, they are not the majority, and they are not even the angriest.It is time for the media, for the Mussolini-in-makeup Trump, for the world to recognize that real Americans, liberals and conservatives driven together in common defense of this nation, real Americans, the ones who believe in democracy, diversity, and innocence-until-proven guilty\u2026 we are angry too.We have had enough of what this man, Trump, has made us look like to the world.We have had enough of the hatreds he has unleashed. And the apologists in the media who have not stood up and called him what he is: A fascist who wants to end this democracy.We have had enough of every third thing coming out of his mouth serving the goals of the terrorists, like ISIS. And the rogue nations like Russia.We have had enough of every lie and excuse and contradiction and him saying he was smart and brilliant not to pay taxes, then his son insisting\u00a0he has paid taxes, then his spokesman refusing to say either way.We have had enough of the constant whining and bleating about how everything has been fixed and rigged against this man, to whom the difficulties of inheriting a fortune and a business are the equivalent of the endless punishment of bigotry against African-Americans. To whom giving money to his employees is as big a sacrifice as a mother and father losing their son in war, to whom the dating scene of the 1970s was his Vietnam.We have had enough of the casual cruelties and the unthinking dolts who applaud them. The boasts after the dead in Orlando, or on the streets of Chicago, or of the discovery of bombs in New York.We have had enough of the attacks on every journalist, every columnist, every news organization \u2013unless their news organization has recently run a poll favorable to him.(h/t RCP Video)Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Breitbart Sports, Breitbart TV, Donald Trump, GQ Magazine, Keith OlbermannComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Marlow7 Oct 20160In an interview for the November issue of Golf Digest, Parnevik said that the 14-time major champion has been \u201chitting a lot of balls, and he\u2019s hitting it great. He\u2019s pounding it a mile and flushing everything,\u201dParnevik, who spent some time watching Tiger hit balls at the range and played nine holes with him at the Medalist Golf Club in Florida, said, \u201cOn the range, at least, his trajectory and ball flight are like the Tiger we knew 15 years ago. Comebacks are never a sure thing, but something tells me his might be spectacular.\u201d The 51-year-old Swedish golfer and Woods have patched things up since their falling out several years ago over Woods\u2019 treatment of his former wife Elin Nordegren. Parnevik introduced Nordegren to Woods when she served as an au pair for Parnevik\u2019s children.Parnevik told GD that he felt betrayed by Tiger when he engaged in extra-marital affairs. \u201cWhen the infidelity came to light, it felt like the worst betrayal ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut over time, I forgave Tiger. He and Elin are friends, which is nice, and he\u2019s a good parent. His mistakes hurt him, too.\u201dWoods, who dominated golf for well over a decade commanding 683 weeks as world No 1, (now ranked 767), has not teed-it-up since August 2015, when he competed at the Wyndham Championship and finished tied for 10th place. After that, Tiger stopped playing and underwent two back surgeries. In September 2015 he had surgery to remove a disc fragment that was pinching a nerve and a month later he had a second surgery to treat a different pinched nerve in his back.\u00a0Woods endured a prior back surgery in 2014 and has had multiple surgeries on his left knee starting in 2008, the year that Woods last won a major tournament.\u00a0Tiger\u2019s former Stanford roommate and longtime friend Notah Begay said last month that he believes this will be Woods\u2019 last attempt to come back from his injuries. \u201cIt will be a new chapter,\u201d said Begay, a former PGA pro who currently serves as an analyst for the Golf Channel. \u201cJust like 1996 was the beginning, this is going to be the beginning of a new chapter for Tiger Woods, and probably his last. He understands that he\u2019s much closer to the end of his career than the beginning and that if he has another injury and has to sustain another rehabilitation period that he might not make it back.\u201dBreitbart Sports, Jesper Parnevik, Safeway Open, Tiger WoodComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Well, one clue in a new poll indicates that one-third of viewers are changing the channel over the anti-American protests during the national anthem.A new Rasmussen poll finds that 32 percent of adults surveyed say that they have stopped watching NFL football because of the protests while only a scant 13 percent said they are more likely to tune in because of the anthem protests.Drilling down into the results shows that more women than men are tired of the Black Lives Matter-like protests with 29 percent of men saying they are less likely to watch pro\u00a0football\u00a0compared to 38 percent of women, who intimated that they are uncomfortable with the protests.The NFL preseason kicked off in controversy when San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to remain seated during the playing of the national anthem instead of standing in honor of the nation\u2019s theme like everyone else was.As the weeks rolled on and Kaepernick began kneeling on the field during the regular season,\u00a0his protest spread not only throughout the NFL but into other sports.As the season rolls into Week Five, though, television ratings have been seen tumbling each week to new lows.The ratings for Week Three\u2019s Sunday featured game between Chicago and Dallas measured in at 12.9 in the Neilsen ratings. This is down from the previous Sunday\u2019s 13.7 and that was down from week one\u2019s 13.9 rating. Ratings also dropped by 18 percent over week three from last year for all the midday regional games, according to Sports Business Daily.The ratings for Monday Night Football are\u00a0even worse. The game between Atlanta and New Orleans received a low 5.7 rating. It was a 38 percent plunge over the same week last year.During these protests, Colin Kaepernick\u2019s reputation has also taken a major hit. Since he started his rants against America, he has become the most hated player in the NFL.Despite that, Kaepernick has continued his anti-American attacks even off the field. Recently he attacked the U.S. saying it has never been great as he talked about Donald Trump\u2019s now well-loved slogan.\u201cHe always says, \u2018Make America great again,'\u201d Kaepernick said\u00a0about Trump.\u00a0\u201cWell, America has never been great for people of color and that\u2019s something that needs to be addressed. Let\u2019s make America great for the first time.\u201dKaepernick\u2019s hate for the country has spread to other sports, and even high schools, have begun indulging these protests. And just last weekend a college marching band drew criticism from its own school administrators for taking a knee during the national anthem.But, if the news on the ratings are any indication, Americans are beginning to get fed up with the constant drumbeat of liberal politics shoehorned into their once beloved forms of apolitical entertainment.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Breitbart Sports, Colin Kaepernick, National Anthem, NFLComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But now it has to reach a point of intolerable. We cannot tolerate this. Lives are being lost.\u201dBut what about suspects cooperating with the police and not escalating matters by being combative? Wouldn\u2019t that help cut down on police shootings? Breitbart Sports asked Baldwin, after Sunday\u2019s Seahawks-Jets game, if any of the blame for police shootings lies with non-cooperative suspects who endanger police.\u201cThat is a non sequitur,\u201d Baldwin responded. \u201cYou are not even following the premise when you ask that question. The reason why that is not even a conversation is law enforcement are given consent. You can Google it. Basically what it says is that they are agents of our government. We give them authority to govern us. So, if an agent of the government is not following the laws and policies or is not well-trained or not getting sufficient training to handle citizens who are not professionally obligated to protect communities, are not professionally obligated to protect communities like law enforcement are, that is where the issue lies.\u201cYes, we can talk about crime in general, but it\u2019s not my neighbor\u2019s job to protect me. It\u2019s law enforcement\u2019s job to protect me, so I want to provide them with the best resources, best tools, best training, so they can go out there themselves in a better manner, protect the communities they serve and ultimately protect their reputation.\u201dBut what about life-threatening situations in which a cop making the wrong split-second decision with an armed suspect could lose his life?\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult job; I\u2019m not taking away from that,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult and dangerous job, but that\u2019s what they signed up for. When you sign up to be a police officer you are consenting to be in those situations. You might not always be in that situation. You might not ever be in that situation, but you are consenting, you know it comes with an inherent risk, so when you are in those situations, you have to lean on your training, lean on your understanding to get yourself through those situations, so you can come home in a safe manner.\u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy to do that, but what I\u2019m saying, what I\u2019m more concerned about is providing better training, better resources, better tools for our law enforcement, so they can make those split-second decisions and make them in a manner where not only is the criminal or the person they have the encounter with can go home safely, but also themselves can go home safely.\u201dBreitbart Sports, Breitbart TV, Law Enforcement, Doug BaldwinComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

A lot can change, but it may be tough for anyone to jump in the mix with the leaders.Others to Watch: QB Mitch Trubinsky (UNC), RB Dalvin Cook (FSU), QB Kenny Hill (TCU), RB Curtis Samuel (Ohio State), RB Mike Weber (Ohio State), QB Brad Kaaya (Miami), RB Leonard Fournette (LSU), QB Tommy Armstrong JR (Nebraska), RB Jeremy McNichols (Boise State).10. QB Josh Dobbs (Tennessee)\u2014There\u2019s a resurgence happening in Knoxville, and Dobbs is at the heart of it. He has thrown six picks over five games, and that hurts him. However, wins over A&M and Alabama could get him conversation as the top SEC candidate.9. QB Jalen Hurts (Alabama)\u2014The QB for the Tide has not thrown an interception since game one. I do not think he is a serious contender, but, if the Tide roll and others falter he may find himself in the conversation if it becomes a \u201cbest player on the best team\u201d contest.8. QB Seth Russell (Baylor)\u2014A poor performance by the signal caller and his team still has both surviving in the Heisman and playoff hunt. Russell will need some big numbers to remain a part of the dark horse conversation.7. QB Trevor Knight (TAMU)\u2014It was not Knight\u2019s best game, but he played a critical role in the win over South Carolina. Upcoming contests against Tennessee and Alabama could vault him up the list a bit.6. RB Christian McCaffrey (Stanford)\u2014The Huskies figured out the formula to shut down the elite stat-accumulating machine. Sadly, McCaffrey\u2019s geography, lack of big remaining games, and strength of competition make it unlikely he becomes a real factor in this race.5. QB Jake Browning (Washington)\u2014There is quite a drop off between #4 and #5, but Browning is in a spot to make a run after his team routed Stanford.4. QB Greg Ward (Houston)\u2014In most years, Ward\u2019s case would look better, but his spot outside of the Power 5 in a year of elite dual-threat quarterbacks makes him more forgettable.2b. QB Deshaun Watson (Clemson)\u2014Three interceptions take the luster off an otherwise strong performance by Watson. I think Barrett is in a slightly better position as the alternative to Jackson, but both quarterbacks are in a much better position this week.2a. QB JT Barrett (Ohio State)\u2014Now the all-time Ohio State leader in passing TDs, Barrett has not put up massive numbers this season, but he will have opportunities to shine.1. QB Lamar Jackson (Louisville)\u2014Jackson lost the game, but he did not lose his lead in the Heisman race. While this is now a closer contest, the numbers Jackson is putting up will make him tough to beat. His Cardinals still could land a playoff spot, but, if they falter, that could open up an opportunity for Watson or Barrett.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

We\u2019ve been dealing with this in the past. And so we\u2019re going to send a tape out in the next week or so and clarify some of these things.

The Big 12 standard bearer, Baylor, survived, though barely. Alternating games between Alabama, Tennessee, and Texas A&M will determine a pecking order in that conference. Clemson now has the lead in the ACC, but Louisville won\u2019t go away. Meanwhile, the OSU-Michigan rivalry looms even larger in the Big 10. Houston, also, sits pretty outside of the Power 5. Still, any number of upsets could drastically change the whole picture. There\u2019s still a lot of great college football to be played with Virginia Tech at UNC, Tennessee at Texas A&M, and Alabama at Arkansas being the top contests this week.Receiving consideration: Auburn, Florida State, North Dakota State, UCLA, Air Force, Georgia, LSU, Arizona State, Indiana, and Maryland.25. Utah 4-1 [Lost to Cal, Last Week #17]\u2014Cal has quickly emerged as one of the more inconsistent yet potentially potent teams in the nation. The Utes learned that the hard way and need a bounce back win over Arizona.24. Virginia Tech 3-1 [Bye, Last Week NR]\u2014If the Hokies can win at UNC, they could be poised for big things in Justin Fuente\u2019s first year.23. Colorado 4-1 [Defeated Oregon State, Last Week NR]\u2014It has been a while since the Buffaloes were relevant. A game at USC will help determine how long they stay that way.22. West Virginia 4-0 [Defeated Kansas State, Last Week NR]\u2014The Mountaineers have not looked strong, but they find themselves in the strong position of being undefeated in a weak conference.21. Western Michigan 5-0 [Defeated Central Michigan, Last Week NR]\u2014Coach PJ Fleck is one of my favorite up and comers, and his team looks ready to dominate in the MAC.20. North Carolina 4-1 [Defeated Florida state, Last Week NR]\u2014It is tough to evaluate the Tar Heels as they have struggled in games and the loss to UGA to start the season looks worse. Still, they have found their stride offensively, and games against Virginia Tech and at Miami these next two weeks could decide the division.19. Boise State 4-0 [Defeated Utah State, Last Week #24]\u2014With the SDSU losing, I now see the Broncos as perhaps the team most likely to go undefeated.18. Florida 4-1 [Defeated Vanderbilt, Last Week #18]\u2014The Gators were rooting for Georgia over UT, and had to be disappointed by the result. Still, they need to look inward after struggling against Vandy.17. Arkansas 4-1 [Defeated Alcorn State, Last Week #22]\u2014It will be a tough stretch ahead for the Hogs who host Alabama, Ole Miss, and visit Auburn. Bret Bielema could have his team in a strong position or find himself on a mildly warm seat at the end of this stretch.16. Oklahoma 2-2 [Defeated TCU, Last Week #21]\u2014A nice bounce back win for the Sooners could set the tone for the rest of the season. The Big 12 is ripe for the taking.15. Stanford 3-1 [Lost to Washington, Last Week #7]\u2014It was a humiliating evening for the Cardinal who likely said goodbye to their playoff hopes.14. Nebraska 5-0 [Defeated Illinois, Last Week #16]\u2014The Cornhuskers should have handled Illinois with greater ease, but I still see this as a team that should enter a visit to Wisconsin 7-0.13. Ole Miss 3-2 [Defeated Memphis, Last Week #15]\u2014The Rebels got revenge against Memphis, and they now have a bye before a tough stretch that sees them visit Arkansas and LSU before hosting Auburn at home.12. Baylor 5-0 [Defeated Iowa State, Last Week #14]\u2014It took a late rally, but the Bears beat the lowly Cyclones. They get a week off to regroup, but they still look like the class of a weak Big 12.11. Miami 4-0 [Defeated Georgia Tech, Last Week #12]\u2014Frankly, we know very little about this Hurricane team. I like Richt, and there is talent on this roster. However, we will learn about the quality of this squad after matchups against Florida State and UNC followed by a short week trip to Blacksburg.10. Wisconsin 4-1 [Lost to Michigan, Last Week #9]\u2014I hate to only \u201cpunish\u201d a losing team by dropping them one spot, but you simply cannot make the argument based on this young season that the Badgers are not a top ten team. Wisconsin has two weeks to prepare for Ohio State.9. Tennessee 5-0 [Defeated Georgia, Last Week #11]\u2014Does this team have any miraculous comebacks left? Firmly in the SEC East driver\u2019s seat, the Vols play at Texas A&M and get Alabama at home in consecutive weeks. Winning one of those games will keep this team in the playoff picture.8. Texas A&M 5-0 [Defeated South Carolina, Last Week #8]\u2014Sumlin\u2019s team struggled against a weak South Carolina squad, and that is cause for concern. Still, this team could rapidly rise with wins over Tennessee at home and then at Alabama, a crucial game to be played after an Aggie bye week.7. Louisville 4-1 [Lost to Clemson, Last Week #2]\u2014The Cardinals fought back on the road against a Clemson team that pushed for the title a year ago. Smart money is on this team, if they win out, to be in the playoff.6. Washington 5-0 [Defeated Stanford, Last Week #10]\u2014The Huskies put any doubts about their legitimacy to rest with a rout of Stanford. Chris Petersen has his program in the driver\u2019s seat in the PAC 12.5. Michigan 5-0 [Defeated Wisconsin, Last Week #6]\u2014The potent Wolverines offense came to a screeching halt against Wisconsin, but this team managed to beat a really tough Badgers squad.4. Houston 5-0 [Defeated UCONN, Last Week #4]\u2014Many will begin waffling on the Cougars, but, if they win out with a schedule that still includes Louisville, they will be in the playoff.3. Clemson 5-0 [Defeated Louisville, Last Week #5]\u2014Deshaun Watson and company have yet to regain their late-season form from a year ago, but they managed to defeat a very good Louisville team. The Tigers play at Florida State on October 29 following a bye. That game, no longer particularly daunting, may be the toughest left on the schedule.2. Ohio State 4-0 [Defeated Rutgers, Last Week #3]\u2014Rutgers is no powerhouse, but Ohio State defeating a Power 5 team 58-0 sends a statement. The Buckeyes look strong.1. Alabama 5-0 [Defeated Kentucky, Last Week: #1]\u2014After coasting for the last two weeks, Alabama heads into the toughest stretch of its schedule with games at Arkansas, at Tennessee, and against Texas A&M. I still see no reason not to expect the Tide to run the table.Breitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

After all, the victims of these crimes would certainly qualify as \u201coppressed\u201d and there are obviously many \u201cbodies in the street\u201d attesting to this. At the epicenter of the tragic black-on-black crime wave is Chicago. According to the Chicago Tribune, there have been 568 homicides this year, 172 more than this time last year. An African American protestor, wearing a gorilla suit and a \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d shirt with \u201cPut Down the Guns\u201d on the back, ran onto Soldier Field this weekend to bring attention to the issue.Breitbart Sports finally got an NFL player to address the perceived double-standard of the protesting players, who blast police actions in dealing with suspects but nary a word on black-on-black crime.Breitbart Sports asked Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin, after Sunday\u2019s Seahawks-Jets game, about the black-on-black crime issue. Baldwin, the son of a police officer, supports Kaepernick.\u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s crime \u2013 black-on-black crime, white-on-white crime, it\u2019s crime,\u201d Baldwin pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s citizens of this country, it\u2019s crime. So first and foremost, you have to take the racist/bigotry goggles off and see that it\u2019s just crime. Second of all, it\u2019s about proximity. Blacks live near blacks, so when you have crime, it\u2019s going to be in those vicinities, just like it is with white crime, crime in general.\u201dBaldwin, who joined the 1,000-yard receiving club last season, captured the nation\u2019s attention when he squatted down in the end zone after scoring a touchdown in Super Bowl 49 and dropped the ball between his legs. He now seeks to attract positive attention as a social-justice activist.\u201cIf we are going to talk specifically about black-on-black crime, in those communities, why are those communities that way?\u201d he asked on Sunday. \u201cAfrican Americans, black people, they didn\u2019t happen to grow up that way, they didn\u2019t just happen to be planted in the United States that way. One-hundred and fifty years ago, it was okay to own a slave, right? So the same reason why we see that the athletic sports are dominated by black people, so the generations of that heritage hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, you are seeing the result of the greatest athletes in the world being 150 years ago as slaves. Now you are saying you want all of this to change?\u201cIn 150 years, it\u2019s not going to change. It\u2019s going to take time.\u201dBaldwin took the time to meet with Seattle police officers on Monday. He leads something called the \u201cBuilding Bridges Task Force\u201d for the Seahawks. He aims for police retraining on a national basis.He says the problems in urban communities mainly stem from external forces.\u201cThe process isn\u2019t just saying they need to educate themselves, they need to get out of it, they need to not be entitled, which is the argument I continue to hear,\u201d Baldwin maintains. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about a process. Two-hundred-and-fifty-six years Africans were enslaved, it\u2019s only been 150 years since slavery was abolished. It\u2019s going to take some time.\u201dBreitbart Sports, Breitbart TV, Law Enforcement, Colin Kaepernick, Doug Baldwin, National AnthemComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

His handlers called off two subsequent rematches, the most recent cancellation came after the failed drug test but before its publication. They said their charge suffers from mental-health issues, which Fury cops to in the interview.The Mancunian says he hasn\u2019t trained since the spring, now weighs 290 pounds, drinks and does cocaine on a near-constant basis, and battles depression and a form of bi-polar disorder. He claims he currently receives psychiatric care.\u201cI\u2019ve been out drinking, Monday to Friday to Sunday, and taking cocaine,\u201d he says of his life since May. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with it and the only thing that helps me is when I get drunk out of me mind.\u201dThe six-foot-nine boxer courted controversy long before this controversy courted him. He dressed as Batman during a press conference promoting his fight against Klitschko to call his mild-mannered opponent a joker. He later cited acceptance of homosexuality, pedophilia, and abortion as signs of the apocalypse, called mixed-martial arts a sport for white kids who can\u2019t box, and opined, \u201cI believe a woman\u2019s best place is in the kitchen and on her back.\u201dThe comments led to an uproar in Great Britain, particularly when the BBC considered him for an annual honor for sportsmen. The colorful personality, even though coupled with a dull style in the ring, brought attention back to the heavyweight division slumping stateside and elsewhere during the reign of the milquetoast Klitschko brothers.But his attention-grabbing reign may end relatively quickly either by his own decision or at the behest of boxing big-wigs eager to move on to a champion who fights contenders rather than demons.Fury announced his retirement earlier this week on Twitter. Then, three hours later, he announced his un-retirement.The heavyweight champion remains honest and defiant about his personal habits.\u201cListen, I\u2019ve done a lot of things in my life,\u201d he tells Rolling Stone. \u201cI\u2019ve done lots of cocaine. Lots of it. Why shouldn\u2019t I take cocaine? It\u2019s my life isn\u2019t it? I can do what I want.\u201cYeah, I have done cocaine. Plenty of people have done cocaine as well. What the fuck has that got to do with anything? That ain\u2019t a performance enhancing drug.

Then he rose to his feet for \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201dBut his play during the game, rather than his antics before it, likely led to his release.The Colts lost the game to the longtime divisional doormat Jacksonville Jaguars 30-27. Jaguars QB Blake Bortles threw for 207 yards and two touchdowns. He ran for another score. Cromartie made four tackles at the Wembley Stadium matchup.\u201cThe four-time Pro Bowler struggled throughout and his play with the Colts was summed up by one series during their Week 4 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Mike Wells writes. \u201cCromartie was beaten twice and called for two penalties on a drive where the Jaguars managed to get a field goal as the first half came to an end. Cromartie was benched in favor of Rashaan Melvin in the second half.\u201dThe Colts rank 30th in points allowed, 24th in passing yards allowed, and 24th in team defense this young season. At 1-3, the team\u2019s generous defense accounts for their last-place standing in a weak division.Cromartie also took a knee for the anthem and raised his clenched fist (pictured above) before a win against the San Diego Chargers at Lucas Oil Stadium a week ago Sunday. That resulted in no repercussions, suggesting the aging corner\u2019s play rather than his political stance catalyzed his release.Cromartie signed a $3 million deal with the Colts prior to the season. He needed the money. Fathering a dozen children by eight different women, with twins arriving last year after a vasectomy, the prolific 32-year-old reportedly owes $336,000 annually in child support. He reportedly averted baby-mama drama, and the consequences of a Florida non-support warrant in the offseason, by signing with the Colts.Cromartie boasts 31 interceptions in eleven seasons with the Chargers, Jets, Cardinals, and Colts.

We understand and respect this is an issue where emotions are strong.The Marching Pirates continue to be fully supportive of all the values the East Carolina University community holds dear.We have met with the band and the members have collectively reaffirmed their commitment to the unique privilege and responsibility that comes with wearing the uniform of the Marching Pirates.College is about learning, and it is our expectation that the members of the Marching Pirates will learn from this experience and fulfill their responsibilities. While we affirm the right of all our students to express their opinions, protests of this nature by the Marching Pirates will not be tolerated moving forward.It is our hope that together we can move past these events and that the Marching Pirates will be part of the healing process, working as one Pirate Nation.Chancellor Staton also issued a separate statement, but one of a far more equivocal nature filled more with bromides than direct policy statements.As an institution of higher learning, East Carolina respects the rights of our students, staff and faculty to express their personal views. That is part of the free exchange of ideas on a university campus. While we acknowledge and understand the disappointment felt by many Pirate fans in response to the events at the beginning of today\u2019s football game, we urge all Pirate students, supporters and participants to act with respect for each other\u2019s views.Statement by #ECU chancellor Cecil Staton on the marching band members kneeling during the anthem. pic.twitter.com/KtZXvWtkSO\u2014 Michael Prunka (@MichaelPrunka) October 1, 2016According to Fox News, fans continued to boo the band during the halftime show, as well.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Breitbart Sports, Colin Kaepernick, East Carolina UniversityComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

(AP) \u2014 With a large tear forming in his left eye, Jack Nicklaus asked everyone from the elite to the everyman to remember the time Arnold Palmer touched their lives during an emotional farewell to the King on Tuesday.\u201cI hurt like you hurt,\u201d Nicklaus said. \u201cYou don\u2019t lose a friend of 60 years and don\u2019t feel an enormous loss.\u201dThe service at Saint Vincent College in Palmer\u2019s hometown was filled with just as much laughter and warmth from stories of the most significant player in the modern game. The basilica at the college was packed with golf\u2019s biggest names from around the world.Charlie Mechem, the former LPGA commissioner who became one of Palmer\u2019s most trusted advisers, referred to them as the \u201celite battalion\u201d of Arnie\u2019s Army.Palmer died Sept. 25 in Pittsburgh as he was preparing for heart surgery. He was 87. His private funeral for family members was Thursday.\u201cWe were looking down at the air strip and the fog just suddenly lifted,\u201d Ernie Els said Tuesday after landing in one of several private jets that descended on Arnold Palmer Regional Airport. \u201cThis is a beautiful day. We\u2019ve all met different people in life. He was a man who didn\u2019t change. It didn\u2019t matter if you cut the grass or you were a president. He was the same with everybody.\u201dPalmer\u2019s co-pilot, Pete Luster, flew his plane around Saint Vincent College for nearly an hour before the service, tipping the left wing as he zoomed by.Mechem set a happy tone by pointing to a large photograph of Palmer with a grin that made everyone feel so important. He asked the crowd to remember the Palmer who hitched up his pants and gave a thumbs-up.\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying that there are no irreplaceable people,\u201d Mechem said, his voice cracking toward the end of the ceremony. \u201cWhoever made that line didn\u2019t know Arnold Palmer. There will never be another.\u201dPalmer won 62 times on the PGA Tour, including seven major championships.The service was another reminder that Palmer was not the greatest golfer who ever lived, or even the best from his generation. He just had the greatest influence through television, through marketing and mostly through eye contact.PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem tried to explain Palmer\u2019s popularity by mentioning his attacking style of golf, his appeal on television and the way he carried himself.\u201cHe had this other thing,\u201d Finchem said. \u201cIt was the incredible ability to make you feel good \u2014 not just about him, but about yourself. I was amazed by how people reacted to him. He took energy from that and turned right around and gave it back.\u201dBreitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Our coaches do a great job of putting in a great game plan, and we just go out there and cover the guys up. Everybody on this defense wants to be great.\u201dThe Vikings (4-0) didn\u2019t record a sack after getting 13 over the past two games, but they were so tight in coverage and sound against the run that the Giants only converted 2 of 12 third downs. Second in the NFL with 12.5 points allowed per contest, the Vikings have conquered quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton and Manning in consecutive games \u2014 the last two league MVP award winners and a two-time Super Bowl champion. They\u2019re 6-2 against Manning in his career.Coach Mike Zimmer was concerned about Beckham, Victor Cruz and Sterling Shepard, as dangerous a trio of pass-catchers as there is in the NFL, so the Vikings didn\u2019t blitz the Giants (2-2) nearly as much as they did Rodgers\u2019 Packers or Newton\u2019s Panthers.\u201cIt just shows our versatility,\u201d linebacker Anthony Barr said.Sam Bradford threw a touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph for the third straight game and kept his turnover-free streak since joining the Vikings intact, and Matt Asiata and Jerick McKinnon each ran for a touchdown as part of a season-high 104 yards rushing for the team. Bradford was 26 of 36 for 262 yards passing, thriving with quick-release throws behind an offensive line that protected better than it had in any of the previous three games.Starting 4-0 for the first time since 2009, the Vikings joined Philadelphia and Denver as the league\u2019s only remaining undefeated teams.\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go. We\u2019re not handing out any medals tonight,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cThe attitude of this team, they like to work. It\u2019s good, and they actually tell me I\u2019m getting soft sometimes.\u201dReally?\u201cYeah, they do,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cThey tell me all the time, \u2018What are you doing? How come we\u2019re not in pads today?'\u201dHere are the top takeaways from the game:RHODES CLOSED: Beckham, who has yet to score this season during the longest touchdown-less streak of his three-year career, was smothered by cornerback Xavier Rhodes . Beckham wasn\u2019t nearly as agitated as he was the week before in his much-scrutinized matchup with Washington cornerback Josh Norman, but he picked up an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he and Rhodes bumped and jawed at each other out of bounds following a short catch in the second quarter.\u201cI\u2019ve just got to know it\u2019s all against me. It\u2019s going to be that way. I have to assume that I\u2019m always in the wrong no matter what,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cThat\u2019s something, it\u2019s a tough pill to swallow, but you have to understand it. You have to be able to cope with it and just keep it moving.\u201dManning expressed more concern about his star receiver\u2019s behavior than he had before.\u201cHe\u2019s got to be aware,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for him, and he\u2019s got to play smart. We can\u2019t afford to do anything.\u201dKICKING CONUNDRUM: Blair Walsh missed his third field goal try in four games this season for the Vikings, this one a 46-yarder that never really had a chance. He has also missed two extra points this year, and Zimmer has sounded more and more like he\u2019s losing patience with his kicker.\u201cWe need to make those or it\u2019s going to bite us in the rear end,\u201d the coach said. \u201cOur team is playing close games. That\u2019s how we\u2019re built.\u201dWalsh did rebound to hit a 44-yarder not long after his miss, following an interception by Rhodes.QUICK PASSES: The Vikings led the NFL with 15 sacks in the first three games, and the Giants clearly preferred a quick-pass attack to neutralize the rush. Manning wasn\u2019t sacked, mostly preferring to dump the ball off on short routes to receivers on slants and backs in the flats. This is what the Vikings must expect now.\u201cYou look around the league, and there\u2019s franchise quarterbacks out there, man,\u201d Munnerlyn said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get those guys hurt. They\u2019re the money men. So you try to protect them and get rid of the ball real fast, and we just got to cover them up.\u201dSTRUGGLING SECONDARY: The Giants\u2019 secondary is depleted by injuries. Trevin Wade had trouble all game starting at cornerback for Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Wade was beaten by Charles Johnson for receptions of 30 and 40 yards, had a pass interference penalty on Rudolph and got away with one on an early incompletion to Adam Thielen.RECIPE FOR TROUBLE: The Giants have a minus-8 turnover margin at the quarter mark of the season. After being penalized 11 times for 128 yards in a loss to Washington last week, they were flagged eight times for 69 yards in this game.___Online:AP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL coverage on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL___Follow Dave Campbell on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/DaveCampbellAPBreitbart SportsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It\u2019s regressed from this silliness to the vile, vulgar insults a class act endured this weekend. Sad.Mike Eruzione of 1980 USA Hockey fame is certainly wringing every bit of celebrity out of that game played 36 years ago. Good for him, I guess. He was a featured guest and walked 18 holes with Phil Mickelson. He chose to wear black leather penny loafers with no socks\u2014a strange choice when you\u2019re going to walk 18 holes.Warning to those who plan to attend a Ryder Cup in the future. Don\u2019t expect to see much golf. With the immense crowds and the fact that on Friday and Saturday there are only four groups out at a time, you just don\u2019t get to see many golf shots. It\u2019s not like a regular tournament where there is play on every hole.

Harwood did not ask about Clinton\u2019s emails.Other emails, including an invitation for lunch, appear more innocuous. Some look simply like pitches for interviews. Regardless, they reveal a close relationship between Harwood and Podesta \u2014 and apparent political support from Harwood.On Jan. 28, 2016, for example, Harwood emailed\u00a0Podesta to report that Clinton had done well at an event in Iowa: \u201cShe was good here in Newton.\u201dAnd on\u00a0March 14, 2016, Harwood emailed Podesta: \u201chow are you feeling about tomorrow?\u201d The next day, March 15, was an important Democratic primary day, when Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and North Carolina voted.Clinton won all five contests \u2014 though by a narrow margin in Missouri and Illinois Harwood wrote again to Podesta: \u201cCongrats \u2013 pretty strong.\u201d Podesta then replied to Harwood in the early hours of March 16: \u201cYup. Feeling good.\u201dRevelations from the Wikileaks email dump are ongoing \u2014 though the media have shown a curious reluctance to highlight them, focusing instead on leaked video of Donald Trump joking about groping women in 2005.Joel B.

I think it is the case that folks in leadership, whether it\u2019s in business or in civil society, or in politics, make slightly different arguments, nuanced arguments to different audiences, when they\u2019re pursuing a laudable public goal, but it\u2019s important to stick to the same principle, even when making different arguments.\u201dHe was then asked, \u201cSo, let\u2019s say the context of those comments would clarify things from her perspective. Why doesn\u2019t she simply release the full transcripts from those Wall Street speeches?\u201dCoons answered, \u201cThat\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t know where these transcripts have been coming from. As I think was mentioned last night in the debate in St. Louis, there\u2019s a real question about the origin of everything that\u2019s being leaked at the moment. The leaders of our intelligence community have suggested that the Russians, who have hacked into a variety of different systems, are selectively leaking them to influence our own elections.\u201dHe added, \u201cWell, it would seem to me that it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest for us to reach across the aisle, to engage those who feel they\u2019re on the outside, to build some confidence in, I think, the strongest candidate for president, Secretary Clinton, and to release things that are now only known in portion.\u201d(h/t Grabien)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton, Chris Coons, Hillary Clinton Wall Street speeches, wall streetComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

She\u2019s got every inch of the high ground right now,\u201d he wrote in response.\u201cWow. You people are a bunch of ninnies,\u201d Palmieri replied, before clarifying that she was only \u201ckidding\u201d after someone appeared upset.Another consultant emailed to say he thought the joke would work, but that it gave Bernie Sanders too much credit for helping her get over her email issues.He pitched a different idea: \u201cI don\u2019t if you all saw it but the hearing went on for 11 hours. Eleven hours. I was kind of expecting around hour #8 Bernie Sanders would burst in and shout \u2013 \u201cenough about your damn emails Hillary!!\u201dPodesta advised them to steer away from email jokes.\u201cI defer if others think this buys us good will with Sanders people, but email jokes in Iowa usually end up badly and don\u2019t we want to move on?\u201d he wrote. (It\u2019s possible that Podesta was referring to Clinton\u2019s widely criticized Snapchat joke about her emails at the Iowa Wing Ding dinner.)Hillary Campaign manager Robby Mook also had a suggestion.\u201cIs there some Apprentice joke to make? I never saw the show,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also the worst person to generate jokes.\u201dIt appears that Palmieri enjoyed\u00a0the thought of a good email joke, suggesting another one\u00a0during a March, 2015 email to discuss a speech to Emily\u2019s List.\u201cI wanted to float idea of HRC making a joke about the email situation at the Emily\u2019s List dinner tonight.

The first question is framed by crediting Clinton with coming within a \u201cwhisker from a Middle East peace deal.\u201d Three of the questions are followed by proposed answers in all CAPS from the Clinton Foundation.* At the very end of your presidency, it seemed that you came a whisker from a Middle East peace deal, and the Clinton parameters are still generally acknowledged to be the basis of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal if it comes. But will it ever come? Aren\u2019t demographics and the growth of settlements making it harder to see a two -state solution emerging any time soon?* For most of human history, China has been the dominant power in the world. We just happen to live in a relatively brief 300-year stretch when China was weak. But is China regaining its customary position as the dominant power in the world today, and should that worry us? Should we just get used to it? And given that China is our creditor, where do we find leverage to change Chinese behavior, whether on Tibet or Taiwan or human rights or trade?1. REMINDER ABOUT GETTING CHINA INTO WTO; AND DEVELOPING APEC TO ENHANCE REGIONAL INFLUENCE; AND WJC ADMIN SUCCESS IN BUILDING-UP THE US ECONOMY AND IMPORTANCE OF HAVING DOMESTIC ECONOMIC STRENGTH* Greece looks as if it\u2019s headed for default, the Euro zone may be imploding, and the American economy is pretty much stagnant.

For voters, Clinton has embraced the rhetoric of a class warrior: Higher taxes on the wealthy. Tougher rules for Wall Street. Empathy for the financial burdens of ordinary Americans.The gap between her private and public remarks helps explain the relatively high levels of distrust that voters, including some of her own supporters, have expressed about the former secretary of state, New York senator and presidential spouse. Privately, to audiences at Goldman Sachs and others, Clinton expressed a philosophy that in some ways clashes with the progressive vision she has articulated while campaigning.Here\u2019s a breakdown of the differences:\u2014WALL STREETIn public, Clinton has taken a hard tack toward Wall Street, opposing any weakening of the regulatory reforms passed after the 2008 financial meltdown. She has warned that Republican lawmakers and Donald Trump want to abolish the stricter rules imposed under the Dodd-Frank law enacted in 2010.\u201cWe should extend the rules passed in Dodd-Frank on Wall Street in crisis and strengthen them both for the big banks and the shadow banking system,\u201d Clinton said in a speech in North Carolina this summer. \u201cAnd I will veto any reforms to repeal those rules and vigorously enforce the law with accountability so Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again.\u201dYet fears have lingered that despite such proclamations, Clinton remains too cozy with major banks and investment funds. The financial sector has been a major source of campaign donations for Clinton. And in a paid speech for a Goldman Sachs symposium in 2013, Clinton suggested that the industry should play a dominant hand in developing its own rules\u201cThere\u2019s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad,\u201d she is quoted as saying in the hacked emails. \u201cHow do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.\u201dMany experts agree that the financial industry itself needs to have some voice in crafting regulations, if new rules are to be effective and provide safety without sacrificing economic growth. But the emphasis in her private speech was much more sympathetic to the financial sector than what some industry watchdogs would wish.\u2014THE MIDDLE CLASSClinton routinely celebrates her connection to average Americans.\u201cMy mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top,\u201d she said in an August speech. \u201cThis is personal for me. I am a product of the American middle class\u2026. I\u2019ve always remembered that I\u2019m the daughter of a small-business owner and the granddaughter of a factory worker \u2013 and proud of both.\u201dYet despite the vast financial riches that she and her husband, Bill, began reaping once he left the presidency in 2001, Clinton even seemed to suggest that they face the same struggles with debt and college costs that many American households do.\u201cWe came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,\u201d Clinton told ABC News in 2014. \u201cWe had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea\u2019s education.\u201dThe Clintons are now worth several tens of millions of dollars, collected from speeches, book deals and other business arrangements. She seldom highlights this wealth in campaign addresses.But she did so in a 2014 speech for Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, the investment management company. Speaking in private, Clinton acknowledged being increasingly isolated from the financial struggles of much of the country, saying, instead, that memories of her middle class past are her primary connection now.\u201cObviously, I\u2019m kind of far removed because the life I\u2019ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy,\u201d she said.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, emails, Hillary Clinton, The middle class, wall streetComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It was a strategy he raised in his taped apology, posted hours after Friday\u2019s leak of the video from 2005 that has rocked his campaign and caused dozens of Republican lawmakers to abandon their support of his candidacy.Trump refused to take questions when he appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey at the St. Louis hotel where he was preparing for the debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. The meeting was posted on his Facebook page. The four women also were invited by Trump to watch the debate inside the debate hall.\u201cMr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me,\u201d Broaddrick said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any comparison.\u201dBroaddrick, a former Arkansas nursing home administrator, first claimed 17 years ago that Bill Clinton raped her during a meeting in Little Rock in 1978. She sued Bill Clinton in 1999; the case was dismissed in 2001. A Twitter account that claimed to be that of Broaddrick revived the allegations on Saturday and was retweeted by Trump. Bill Clinton has long denied her account.Jones, a former Arkansas state worker, alleged in 1991 that Bill Clinton propositioned and exposed himself to her. In 1994, she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. Bill Clinton\u2019s lawyers tried to have the suit dismissed. In November 1998, he paid Jones $850,000 to settle the case without apologizing or acknowledging culpability.\u201cI think they should all look at the fact that (Trump) is a good person,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s not what other people have been saying he\u2019s been, like Hillary. He\u2019s going to make America great again.\u201dWilley, a former White House volunteer, is using a website to again accuse Bill Clinton of forcing himself on her in 1993. He denied her charge and an independent prosecutor later concluded there was no evidence to doubt that denial.Kathy Shelton, a fourth woman who appeared with Trump at the hotel conference room, was an Arkansas sexual assault victim whose assailant was defended by Hillary Clinton.In 1975, at age 12, Shelton was sexually assaulted in northwest Arkansas. Clinton was asked by a judge overseeing the case to represent Shelton\u2019s alleged attacker. After the prosecution lost key evidence, Clinton\u2019s client entered a plea to a lesser charge. In an interview a decade later, Clinton expressed horror at the crime, but was recorded on tape laughing about procedural details of the case. The audio has been seized on by conservative groups looking to attack Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy.On Friday, The Washington Post and NBC released a video of Trump, unaware he was on a hot microphone, suggesting that he forced himself on women to \u201cgrab them by the p\u2014-\u201d and that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.

And you want them, through their RTs, to influence the press\u2019 impressions.Rospars should know: he headed up Obama\u2019s extremely successful digital campaigns in 2008 and again in 2012, including a \u201cFight the Smears\u201d initiative that encouraged supporters to spam their friends with information debunking rumors about then-candidate Barack Obama.Signing up for either network will mostly just get you an inbox full of campaign-related buzzwords, as well as requests to signal boost select messages. Especially popular users with substantial followers may be invited to an exclusive Slack channel by the Clinton campaign, or participate in exclusive conference calls with Trump\u2019s.Though the messages are similar, the content and tactics are notably different. While Clinton\u2019s camp encourages participants to spread messages from prominent Democrats, \u201cthird-party validators,\u201d and celebrities, Trump takes a more direct approach. You\u2019ll only be asked to generate buzz around tweets by the campaign or the GOP nominee himself, the vast majority of those directly focused on challenging his opposition.So far, it\u2019s difficult to say which strategy has proven more effective. Internet popularity is an inexact metric at the best of times, and social media has a uniquely short attention span.

When they see hatred going on, they have to report it,\u201d Trump said.The questioner did not refer to Americans being killed in terror attacks, but suggested that Muslims are indirect victims of the jihad attacks.\u00a0\u201cWith Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\u201d the questioner said.\u00a0There were no warnings about numerous pending Islamic attacks, including the Boston bombings, the 2015 San Bernardino attack and the recent bombings in New Jersey, despite evidence of extensive preparations.In his response to the question, Trump cited the San Bernardino attack:In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.In her response to the same question, Hillary Clinton criticized Trump for his insistence on greater cooperation from Muslims, and she\u00a0downplayed the question of whether Muslims should do more to alert police when fellow Muslims are preparing to killed Americans. It\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims,\u201d she said.  We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see. Clinton also insisted there\u2019s no conflict between Islam and the non-Islamic West, despite the statements by Islamic attackers that they\u2019re motivated by Islam. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.Under President Barack Obama, various Islamic political groups have opposed bipartisan demands for cooperation, and have successfully lobbied for restrictions on FBI investigations. These groups have also successfully pushed the establishment media to use the term, \u201cIslamophobia\u201d which suggests that Americans\u2019 reaction to terror attacks\u00a0is excessive. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, jihad, terrorismComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Spring and fall 2007 polls showed Clinton enjoying a substantial, double-digit lead, according to Real Clear Politics. A Denver Post survey conducted shortly before the caucus showed a two-point edge favoring Senator Obama, however. The New York Times would later report that Obama was victorious by a 2-to-1 margin, enjoying 67 percent support compared to Clinton\u2019s 32.The leaked Podesta email does not offer any additional basis for their concerns apart from the assertions of trusted Clinton confidants.Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 rhetoric with respect to election integrity concerns has been largely in-step with the Democrat Party line that voter fraud is an imaginary menace and any attempt to combat it otherwise should be seen as a \u201cblast from a Jim Crow past\u201d. During a January 2016 speech dedicated to \u201cvoting rights\u201d in Houston, Texas, she called on proponents of voter ID and similar policies \u201cto stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they\u2019re so scared of letting citizens have their say.\u201dOf additional note is the inclusion of Mr. Elias and his tasking to help prevent \u201cineligible voters\u201d from possibly stealing Colorado and others from Clinton again. One month after the email was apparently sent, the Clinton election attorney would receive considerable recognition from The New York Times and others for accepting $5 million direct from progressive financier George Soros to attack voter ID and other election integrity reforms in multiple states. Proponents of such reforms argue that the laws are designed to keep ineligible ballots from being cast at the polling place.Logan Churchwell is the Assistant Editor and a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.

For a guy like Mr. Trump, there is no more terrifying threat. And for the good of American industry and freedom \u2014 as well as rich people like Mr. Trump \u2014 that should keep him up at night and laser-focused on winning this election.In Sunday night\u2019s debate, Mr. Trump raised the stakes to similar levels for\u00a0Mrs. Clinton. If elected, he said, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her disastrous and reckless handling of classified emails as secretary of state.Just when you thought this campaign could not get any wilder.Mutual.Assured.Destruction.Then Mr. Trump punctuated the threat as Mrs. Clinton prattled on about how unfit the real estate mogul is to hold the office she so desperately wants.\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good,\u201d she sing-songed, \u201cthat someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country \u2014\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Trump interjected with a vicious spear.Not since Daniel entered the lion\u2019s den has any mortal walked into a room with a fierce political machine and a monolithic media more resolutely against him.Teeth bared. Drooling. Pawing at the ground as they circled him, smelling the blood coming out of his wherever from the wound caused by a nasty vulgar tape from a hot mic 11 years ago of the real estate mogul talking about scoring women.Seriously, you have a billionaire who cuts deals with the richest and nastiest titans of Wall Street and New York real estate and talks in vile terms about bedding women, and this is a surprise to someone? Did any of these vultures watch the movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d?This same guy builds monumental phallic edifices emblazoned with his name in giant gold letters and flies big jets with his name down the side, and these people are shocked to learn he is capable of crudeness and bravado? TRIGGER WARNING: They guy loves beauty pageants so much he has actually owned them!At the time of the recording, Mr. Trump was guest starring in a soap opera, promoting a show that was in itself a shameless promotion for his own \u201creality\u201d show and these people are shocked to hear Mr. Trump bragging about his prowess in the sack and his ability to command desirous women?Seriously, these people lead sadly sheltered lives.And then THEY complain that it\u2019s all not suitable for children, yet THEY are the ones who brought it up and will not stop talking about it?The release of this decade-old tape, of course, was perfectly calculated between the Clinton campaign and the shameless media to extinguish any hopes of a Trump resurgence in Sunday night\u2019s debate.Well, they better hope that tape kills him. Because the Donald Trump that showed up for Sunday night\u2019s debate utterly destroyed Hillary Clinton.The Donald Trump that showed up for this debate could win this election in a walk.

Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy and\u2026 Can we cut?\u201d the millennial African-American actress says in the opening before her conscience forces her to stop.When asked off-camera what the problem is, she replies, \u201cI can\u2019t say these words.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m saying,\u201d she continues.When the director off-camera says, \u201cbut you\u2019re an actress,\u201d she tells him, \u201cI\u2019m not that good of an actress.\u201d As she exits the frame, the actress\u00a0mutters to herself, \u201cHonest and trustworthy\u2026 give me a break.\u201dAt the end of the commercial, titled \u201cCut,\u201d a graphic appears on the screen declaring: \u201cSOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER LIARS THAN OTHERS.\u201dThe Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC is putting $350,000 behind the ad, which will air on television in Ohio and Pennsylvania and be digitally targeted to other key battleground states.In national and state polls, voters overwhelmingly view Clinton as someone who is less honest and trustworthy than Donald Trump. In addition, Clinton does not receive the support from minority and young voters, especially in key swing like Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, that President Barack Obama got in 2008 and 2012.As the New York Times recently noted, \u201cmany Democrats are expressing alarm at the lack of enthusiasm, and in some cases outright resistance, some black millennials feel toward Mrs. Clinton.\u201d The Times pointed out that \u201cto replicate President Obama\u2019s success in crucial states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, [Clinton]\u00a0cannot afford to let the percentage of the electorate that is black slip far below what it was in 2012.\u201dThe ad, which has been dubbed as \u201cone of the most amusing\u201d and effective ones of the election cycle, may stick in the minds of voters because they will have initially thought that they were viewing a pro-Clinton ad before the script was flipped on them. And it may convince just enough voters, especially young and minority voters, to not support Clinton in November.Watch the full spot above.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton, Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC, Hillary Clinton, Millennial votersComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pulled all American forces out of the hard-fought gains in Iraq, that literally created a vacuum in which the murderous and barbarous terrorist organization ISIS was able to overrun vast areas that had been hard-won by the American soldier. There are heroes in our midst that served in operation Iraqi freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom. There are Gold Star families among us. Would anyone who has worn the uniform of the United States of America, would you stand or raise your hand and allow us to thank you for your service to the United States of America?\u201dHe continued, \u201cIt breaks my heart to think of the hard-fought gains and sacrifices made to win security in Iraq by 2009 in the way it was squandered.And the American soldiers being called on again to win back what it already had won. It was Hillary Clinton and her State Department that left Americans in harms way in Benghazi.

She lies even when she doesn\u2019t have to.For instance, while campaigning in Iowa, she told a group of supporters that her grandparents were immigrants to the United States.\u201cAll of my grandparents, you know, came over here,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I sit here and I think, well you\u2019re talking about the second, third generation. That\u2019s me, that\u2019s you.\u201dThe story was untrue. One of her grandparents was an immigrant; three were not.Another time Hillary said, \u201cI actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before [Obama] did\u201d\u2014a statement that earned her a Pinocchio for lying from \u201cThe Fact Checker\u201d in the Washington Post.Hillary lied when she said that she \u201cdid not mail any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.\u201d It turned out that there were more than two thousand such documents on her email server\u2014twenty-two of which were marked \u201cspecial access program,\u201d a level of classification higher than top secret.She lied when she said that she employed her private email \u201cas a convenience\u201d so that she could use a single phone for both work and personal communications. It turned out that she owned several electronic devices and that, in any case, Huma Abedin carried them for her.She lied when she said she had voluntarily turned over all her work emails to the State Department. It turned out that she relinquished those emails only when forced to under subpoena, and that she withheld dozens of Benghazi-related emails she had exchanged with her back-channel fixer Sidney Blumenthal.\u201cClinton has repeated numerous times that the [email] arrangement was \u2018allowed,\u2019 though no one in the administration has ever said they approved her server,\u201d wrote The Hill\u2019s A. B. Stoddard. \u201cSo Democrats\u2014like Republicans\u2014assume she is making a misleading statement about her own unorthodox decision to do something no Cabinet secretary had ever done before.\u201dShe lied when, according to the New York Times, she told the FBI that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had advised her to conduct unclassified state business using a private email account. Powell, one of the most respected elder statesmen in the country, quickly denied the report. \u201cHer people have been trying to pin it on me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.\u201dHillary lied when she said that as secretary of state she did not grant special favors to foreigners who donated money to the Clinton Foundation. As I documented with eyewitness accounts in Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary, wealthy foreign donors who gave millions to the foundation received special treatment. One such donor was a Canadian businessman who was granted permission to sell control of 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium production capacity to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. After the deal went through, Bill Clinton was invited to Moscow to give a speech. He was paid $500,000.\u201cThe Clinton Foundation was ostensibly set up to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems,\u201d writes David Harsanyi, senior editor at The Federalist. \u201cAlthough it has done some fine work, it\u2019s most fruitful program has been leveraging [Hillary] Clinton\u2019s position in the State Department to enrich her family, friends and cronies. The foundation was a center of influence peddling. Rock stars. Soccer players. Conglomerates. Crown princes. All of them paid in. All of them expected access to the U.S. government.\u201d And most of them got it.Indeed, more than half of the private citizens who were granted access to Hillary while she was at Foggy Bottom\u201485 out of the 154 who got face time or spoke to her\u2014donated to the foundation, for a total of $156 million.The membrane that should have prevented seepage between the State Department and the foundation turned out to be totally permeable. \u201cLaura Graham, a senior executive at the foundation,\u201d reported the New York Post, left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills, Hillary\u2019s chief of staff.\u201d And when Mills wasn\u2019t taking telephone calls from Graham and doing favors for foundation donors, she was traveling to New York City to interview job candidates for a top job at the foundation.The impact of Hillary\u2019s menagerie of lies was reflected in public opinion polls. Sixty percent of Americans considered her \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d And when Gallup asked Americans what word came to mind when they heard the name \u201cHillary Clinton,\u201d a majority replied \u201cdishonest/liar/don\u2019t trust her/poor character.\u201dTo deal with this problem, her friends and campaign staffers set about trying to make Hillary more likeable.\u201cShe needs to try to humanize herself, because in some ways she\u2019s kind of become a cardboard cutout figure,\u201d said liberal historian Douglas Brinkley.But rehabilitating Hillary at this stage in her life (she turns sixty-nine on October 26) was more easily said than done.\u201cHillary still obsesses about money, a narrative thread that has existed since she was thwarted in her desire to build a pool at the governor\u2019s mansion in poor Arkansas and left the White House with a doggie bag full of sofas, rugs, lamps, TVs and china, some of which the Clintons later had to pay for or return,\u201d writes New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. \u201cEven Chelsea was cashing in, getting a ridiculous, $600,000-a-year scion salary from NBC, far greater than that of many of the network\u2019s correspondents. As a Clinton White House aide once explained to me, \u2018Hillary, though a Methodist, thinks of herself like an Episcopal bishop who deserves to live at the level of her wealthy parishioners, in return for devoting herself to God and good works.\u2019\u201dAnd the social critic Camille Paglia puts it this way: \u201cSo much must be overlooked or discounted\u2014from Hillary\u2019s compulsive money-lust and her brazen indifference to normal rules to her conspiratorial use of shadowy surrogates and her sociopathic shape-shifting in policy positions for momentary expedience.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton, edward klein, Guilty as Sin, Hillary ClintonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He spoke of the high standards to which those who call themselves Christians are called. Pence then added, \u201cWe all fall short of the glory of God, and there is no one righteous, other than the One.\u201d\u201cThe other part of my faith is, I believe in grace. I believe in forgiveness,\u201d continued Pence. \u201cWe have been forgiven.\u201dIn Pence\u2019s prior acknowledgement of Trump\u2019s apology, he expressed hope that America would see Trump\u2019s heart during the debate. Pence had also said that he was \u201cgrateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.\u201d He then said he was praying for the Trump family.On Monday afternoon in Charlotte, Pence told the crowd that during the debate, Trump indeed \u201cshowed heart, humility; then he fought back.\u201dPence moved on to speak of what the Trump-Pence administration would bring. \u201cThis election, it\u2019s not just a choice between two people; it\u2019s a choice between two futures. \u2026 I choose a stronger America at home and abroad. \u2026 I choose an America that stands up for the constitutional principles.\u201dHe spoke of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will lead to a more prosperous future. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take the advice of Hillary\u2019s husband,\u201d said Pence, referencing former President Bill Clinton\u2019s statements at a rally, where he called Obamacare crazy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to renegotiate NAFTA so it works for the American economy,\u201d said Pence.Pence went on to say that government wants to be involved in every aspect of our lives.He pivoted, then, to the Supreme Court, stating that the\u00a0next president will likely decide\u00a0the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.Pence said the U.S. \u201cmust decide here and now that the person we elect as the next President of the United States is Donald Trump.\u201d This is essential,\u201d he said, \u201cfor sake of the rule of law, the Constitution, life, Second Amendment, right to keep and bear arms.\u201d\u201cI was awfully proud of my running mate last night,\u201d Pence said, returning to the subject of Sunday night\u2019s debate. He told the crowd that the media continues to ignore the avalanche of corruptions that come out of the Clintons.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump went out on that stage last night and put the truth before the American people,\u201d Pence said. He then revisited the issues that Clinton\u2019s private foundation took millions from foreign donors as she headed up the State Department, that she destroyed emails from a private server, and her use of high technology to erase emails.Clinton\u2019s private speeches to foreign financial groups came up, as well. Pence referenced the WikiLeaks release of the emails of John Podesta, a close adviser to President Obama. Podesta was also chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton and current Chairman of Hillary for America. He spoke of the hemispheric market with \u201cOpen trade and open borders,\u201d documented in the emails, the accuracy of which the Clinton campaign has not refuted.Pence spoke of when he first got to know the Trumps during\u00a0the summer. \u201cTo know the Trumps is to know a family,\u201d said Pence.Pence told the crowd that in Donald Trump and Mike Pence they have two people who\u00a0will fight every day for the American Dream for everyone in this nation.\u201cI truly do believe that now is the time to do all that we can,\u201d said Pence, who suggested that those who are inclined could bend a knee and pray for the country.Clinton and Trump have jockeyed for the advantage, often within the statistical margin of error, in North Carolina polls in the\u00a0past several months. A Real Clear Politics average of five recent polls gives Clinton the current advantage over Trump by 2.6 percent, in part due to a late September poll that gave her a six-point advantage. The most recent poll included in that average, High Point, showed Clinton up just one point.

He challenged her on her emails, her unremarkable record in the U.S. Senate, and her unsuccessful record as Secretary of State. She was defensive yet not adequately defending. Trump reminded people of a few simple facts: she represents a failed, rigged system that benefits the powerful and wealthy; policies that will make Americans less wealthy and ISIS more emboldened; a knack for lying that jumped to a whole new level on Sunday.Trump\u2019s debate win has set off a spiral amid the legacy and establishment media and sent the Clinton campaign into damage control as WikiLeaks published its second of many tranches of emails from her campaign chairman John Podesta on Monday morning.Trump has now moved past the worst stretch in his campaign, the release of a tape in which he is seen and heard making vulgar remarks about women. That set back his effort to gain momentum after his running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s win in the Vice Presidential debate over Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) a week ago.Trump is hitting the campaign trail in the key battleground states of Florida and Pennsylvania early this week as he takes the campaign that Clinton threw into the gutter back to a focus on the issues like trade, immigration, jobs, the economy and national security.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, 2016 presidential election, debate, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, KellyAnne ConwayComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

McCabe10 Oct 2016Washington0\u201cI think this whole tape\u2026 video tape thing was planned, I think it was timed, I think it might have even been a conspiracy among establishment Republicans who have known about it for weeks and who tried to time it to do the maximum damage to Donald Trump, and I just\u2026 I just think it just backfired on them,\u201d said Jerry Fawell Jr., an attorney, who succeeded his father at the helm of the Lynchburg, Virginia college.On Monday, the Speaker told members of the Republican House Conference that he would not campaign with Trump, nor would he defend Trump, according to an NBC News report based on a background conversation with a Ryan spokesman. NBC was the owner of the Access Hollywo0d tape that The Washington Post\u00a0released Friday revealing the GOP nominee using direct and foul language in reference to courtship and the way women interact with celebrities.Falwell told Cosby he was upset by the tape and how it was received by members of his family, but it did not shake his support for the New York City developer.Cosby asked Falwell if his narrative was conjecture and he told her it was based on real conversations he had with people familiar with Republican conspirators.Falwell, who endorsed Trump in January, said, \u201cI just think some of the establishment Republicans\u2014I\u2019m not going to name any names, I\u2019ve got some independent information, but I\u2019m not going\u2026 I\u2019m not going to reveal it on the air\u2014but I think some of the establishment folks who reluctantly endorsed him had this planned all along as a way to slither out of the endorsement, and I think it backfired on them, and I\u2019m glad to see that.\u201dWhen Cosby pressed Falwell, he was more direct: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence that it came out right before Trump was supposed to appear with Paul Ryan at a rally, and it conveniently gave Paul Ryan a way to disinvite Trump.\u201dThe Trump surrogate said he has heard for a while from trusted Republican sources that something was being planned that would allow the GOP leaders to take Trump off the ticket.\u201cIt was just something that, that I was told was going to come down in October,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would probably result in Trump not being the nominee.\u201dListen to the complete interview here.\u00a02016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Access Hollywood, Jerry Fawell Jr, Liberty University, Moral Majority, Speaker Paul D.

In several speeches that year, Clinton referred to Xi, who took office in late 2012, as a promising new leader for the communist country, particularly when compared to predecessor Hu Jintao.\u201cThe new president of China is a much more sophisticated actor than his predecessor. He lived in the United States for a short period of time, actually lived in Iowa on a \u2014 on a farm. He was working in agricultural issues within the Communist party, you know, about 30 years ago. He is a better politician than his immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao,\u201d Clinton is quoted as saying in a speech allegedly given to the CME group in November 2013, a year after he took office.The remarks echo a similar quotation from June of that year, where Wikileaks cites Clinton as saying, \u201cHe\u2019s a more sophisticated, more effective public leader than Hu Jintao was. He is political in the kind of generic sense of that word. You can see him work a room, which I have watched him do. You can have him make small talk with you, which he has done with me.\u201dIn that same speech \u2013 remarks at a Goldman Sachs event, according to Wikileaks \u2013 Clinton praised Xi for \u201cdoing much more to try to assert his authority\u201d over the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the Chinese military. She allegedly argued that Hu had \u201cnever really captured the authority over the PLA that is essential for any government,\u201d turning the PLA into something of a loose cannon \u201cmaking some foreign policy\u201d independent of the civilian authority of Beijing.\u201cSo President Xi is doing much more to try to assert his authority, and I think that is also good news,\u201d she reportedly said.Since Xi took office, the PLA has been significantly more active in the South China Sea, where Xi\u2019s government claims territory belonging to Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. A verdict from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague has done nothing to deter China from continuing to construct military facilities and artificial islands on territory it has no legal sovereignty over in the region.In that same speech, Clinton\u00a0accused the PLA of supporting North Korea, which China has been more vocal in condemning during Xi\u2019s tenure, though China remains Pyongyang\u2019s biggest trade partner and benefactor. \u201cThe biggest supporters of a provocative North Korea has been the PLA. The deep connections between the military leadership in China and in North Korea has really been the mainstay of the relationship,\u201d Wikileaks quotes Clinton as saying:So now all of a sudden new leadership with Xi and his team, and they\u2019re saying to the North Koreans\u2014and by extension to the PLA\u2014no. It is not acceptable. We don\u2019t need this right now. We\u2019ve got other things going on. So you\u2019re going to have to pull back from your provocative actions, start talking to South Koreans again about the free trade zones, the business zones on the border, and get back to regular order and do it quickly.Since Wikileaks claims Clinton made those remarks, praising Xi for getting tough on North Korea, dictator Kim Jong-un has conducted two more nuclear tests. After the earlier of the two, which occurred in January, the Chinese government claimed that containing North Korea was \u201ca U.S. obligation\u201d and that \u201c\u2018the U.S. should not always try to outsource its problems to China.\u201dThe Clinton campaign has not categorically denied the veracity of the documents. Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine said\u00a0he had \u201cno way of knowing the accuracy of documents dumped by this hacking organization\u201d on CNN.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think we can dig in documents dumped by WikiLeaks and just assume they\u2019re all accurate and true.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Hillary Clinton, National Security, China, Hillary Clinton, WikiLeaks, Wikileaks document dumpComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But what they do reflect is the dedication and enthusiasm of a candidates\u2019 online supporters. Both candidates\u2019 fans have access to the same tools to game the polls \u2014 trolls, bots, etc. Pro-Clinton Super PAC Correct the Record has reportedly spent seven figures on online warfare. Yet Trump fans are still overwhelming the left in this facet of psy-ops, producing screenshot after screenshot of \u201cpolls\u201d showing The Donald ahead.Clinton backers know logically that this phenomenon does not necessarily affect the offline electorate, yet they still feel the need to debunk the meme \u2014 which wastes their time and energy while making them look bitter and defensive.It makes sense, then, that most national conservative sites and local news sites did another round of online snap polls, but at least a half dozen\u00a0left-leaning national outlets skipped them after the second debate.Time MagazineLast time around, Time\u2019s online snap poll went Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 42. Instead of a \u201cwho won the debate\u201d poll, the magazine bizarrely asked: \u201cWhich Presidential Candidate is Better for Your Money?\u201d The current spread on that poll is Trump 89 \u2013 Clinton 11.SlateLast time: Trump 54 \u2013 Clinton 46. This time: Hillary won. She won so much! What does all this winning mean?FortuneFortune had the slimmest margin of most high-profile online polls after the first debate, Trump 51 \u2013 Clinton 49 after 400,000+ votes. This time around, the site\u2019s editors silently skipped a shot at another 400,000 hits.The HillRound one: Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 36 \u2013 Draw 6. Round two: crickets.CBS\u00a0New YorkLast time around, CBS New York\u2019s online poll went roughly Trump 58 \u2013 Clinton 42 with ~41,000 votes. Surely it is only a coincidence that the site did not conduct an online poll Sunday night.CNBCWith half as many votes and the same tight margin as Fortune\u2019s 51-49 split, CNBC must have found the result of their last online poll too demoralizing to risk a repeat.Most establishment news outlets are touting a \u201cscientific\u201d poll by CNN and ORC which says that 57 percent of debate watchers declared Clinton the victor on Sunday night. Left out of that top-line figure: 58 percent of their sample \u201csaid they were supporting Clinton before the debate [emphasis added].\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Donald Trump, Drudge Poll, Hillary Clinton, Online Poll, Presidential Debate, Snap PollComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In reference to a tweet at close to 3 a.m., Cooper selectively repeated four words of one 25 word tweet:In 2008, you wrote in one of your books the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said if a leader doesn\u2019t have it \u201cHe or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?Trump\u2019s tweet was about Clinton and former beauty queen Alicia Machado, and did mention a sex tape. Clinton used Machado to criticize Trump in the first debate.Trump later responded to criticism of tweeting late at night:For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Trump responded to Cooper, \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful girl scout who was no girl scout. By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who\u2019s going to answer it the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what, she didn\u2019t answer because when ambassador Stevens.\u201dCooper followed up on his question, interrupting Trump:\u00a0\u201cThe question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\u201dTrump continued:Six-hundred times. Well she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning and she also sent a tweet out at 3:00 in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But, she said she\u2019ll be awake.\u2026Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help and the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy by the way. So you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that. Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not unproud of it to be honest with you.Cooper then tried to ask Hillary Clinton the same question\u00a0about Trump.\u201cSecretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader.\u201dClinton responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to which Trump said \u201cI\u2019m shocked to hear that.\u201dIn the 2008 presidential primary election, Clinton\u2019s primary election campaign ran a television ad asking viewers who they want answer the phone at the White House at 3 a.m. when \u201csomething\u2019s happening in the world.\u201d She lost that primary election to then-Sen. Barack Obama.Clinton has been criticized for not being more responsive during the terror attack on Americans in Benghazi.

Her record in foreign policy sucks. She has no love for the military. She\u2019s a criminal, and she ought to be in prison. I mean, I\u2019m just being blunt: this is a woman who ought to be in prison right now. If you or I had done what she has done, we would be in handcuffs in an orange suit, and we would be in a maximum security federal prison right now.\u201dClovis said it was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d to construe Trump\u2019s call for a special prosecutor during the debate as a banana republic-style threat to jail his political opponent.\u201cDirector Comey has already come out and said she essentially lied to the FBI,\u201d he noted. \u201cMartha Stewart lied to the FBI, and she went to prison. If Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, she ought to be prosecuted. And right now, what we have is, we have a deal struck by the Clinton campaign with the Obama administration, and I think if push comes to shove, I think Obama will pardon her before this thing gets out of hand because if they think anything is going to reveal that she has committed more criminal acts than she already has, then I think he\u2019ll pardon her. I really do. I think this is in the works. And I don\u2019t think the American people are really fooled by this.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is establishing the rule of law, and the rule of law applies to everyone. That includes the former secretary of state,\u201d Clovis declared.Marlow asked how the Trump campaign planned to strategize around the intense media focus on his \u201chot mic\u201d lewd remarks, \u201cconsidering that even the Republican Party is now destroying Donald Trump over these comments.\u201d\u201cWell, I think again it goes to the substance of what we have is, we have a vulnerability in the campaign,\u201d Clovis replied, adding, \u201cThis is a vulnerability. Let\u2019s make no mistake. Let\u2019s be honest about this. We have a situation here, comments that were made 11 years ago. They were recorded, and they\u2019ve come back to haunt the candidate. The candidate has apologized for those remarks.\u201cAnd I think what it goes to is the fact that they don\u2019t want to focus on policy. They don\u2019t want to focus on the substance of the issues\u00a0because the establishments of the Republican Party and the Democrat Party writ large are deeply threatened by a populist movement in this country.\u201cI really think this is why you see these weak-kneed, lily-livered Republicans out here \u2013 I have other words, but I can\u2019t use them on the radio \u2013 that go to the heart of what I think is a despicable display of cowardice on the part of the Republican Party over this whole issue.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to defend the comments. I think the comments were bad, and frankly, if my son had said something like that, I\u2019d have taken him back to the woodshed. I don\u2019t have any problems talking about that and saying that because that\u2019s what I think of the comments.\u201cThe other side of it is, the comments aren\u2019t what we\u2019re after. What we\u2019re after is the substance of who\u2019s going to lead this country. And that\u2019s what we ought to be focused on because the alternative of having Hillary Clinton as President of the United States is just too terrible to contemplate.\u201dAs for the Trump campaign\u2019s short-term 48-hour game plan, Clovis said, \u201cI think what you\u2019re gonna see is, we\u2019re gonna have comments, we\u2019re gonna come out and talk about these issues, gonna go back on the campaign trail, gonna go back out and re-establish the momentum we have talking about the issues, and that\u2019s what Mr. Trump is going to focus on.\u201dHe said Trump would be \u201ccontrite,\u201d and he would \u201cstand up, and at every stop he\u2019s going to say, \u2018Hey, look, I made a mistake. I wasn\u2019t running for president 11 years ago, and what I said was wrong, and it\u2019s hurtful, and I feel bad about it. It was regrettable on my part.\u2019 And then, let\u2019s move on.\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s the deal: If the media are going to concentrate on these comments, I really think what we\u2019re looking at is the American people; this will be a backlash,\u201d Clovis predicted. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really focused on here, right now, are the people who are gonna be weak on voting for Donald Trump anyway. And what they\u2019re trying to do is, the media are trying to solidify that vote, that they will take away or get the people who may or may not be committed to Donald Trump. Donald Trump voters are not gonna go away. They\u2019re gonna be there, and I think they\u2019re gonna be there in numbers that we haven\u2019t polled yet.\u201dClovis said he doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat Speaker Ryan or the rest of the party is up to,\u201d but guessed there are \u201csome concerns on the establishment side on down-ballot issues.\u201d He disputed the idea that Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was faring poorly enough to make the Republican\u2019s hold on the House tenuous: \u201cMy own experience in electoral politics is that this coattail thing is way overblown. People are going to go in and vote for the president. If they like their congressman or woman, they\u2019re going to vote for them. If they like their senator, they\u2019re going to vote for them. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s at the top of the ticket, and all the other issues that are ongoing there. I just don\u2019t believe that that is as strong a phenomenon as a lot of other people would like to put out.\u201dHe went on to say, \u201cWhat I do think is, there are a lot of people who are concerned about how the chess table will look, once the election is over, and whether or not you\u2019re going to have people that you can control inside the Republican caucus. If you have a majority \u2013 and I think we\u2019ll hold on to the House, I think the Senate, you know, it could be problematic.\u201d\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he asserted, \u201cwe see most of the senators are running strong races, and it looks like we\u2019re going to hold the Senate in the Republican Party. So I think what a lot of this is about is what the chess table\u2019s going to look like when it\u2019s over, win or lose. If Trump wins, that covers up a lot of quirks and blemishes. If he doesn\u2019t win, then I think the Republican Party is going to retrench and double down. I think you\u2019re going to see an even stronger divide between the conservative and populist movement in the Republican Party, and the establishment/big government side.\u201dClovis predicted that the\u00a0\u201cproblem in the Republican Party is not going away.\u201d He elaborated by saying that \u201cthis is something that\u2019s going to manifest itself for the next three to five election cycles, and we\u2019ll have to see who\u2019s going to win. I really think this is a struggle that the Republican Party, and especially the leaders of the Republican Party, are gonna have to come to grips with because this coalition that Donald Trump\u2019s put together is not like any we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dClovis thought Trump\u2019s top moment in the second debate was \u201cthe Lincoln comment that he laid on Mrs. Clinton.\u201d\u201cI think the low moment really was in the first 15 or 20 minutes,\u201d he continued. \u201cI cannot tell you how much I deplore the TMZ style of these debates. And let me add another lowlight: I had a lot of confidence in Anderson Cooper. I have somewhat of a relationship with him, a professional relationship, and I really have always liked him. I don\u2019t think he covered himself in glory last night, and I thought Martha Raddatz was horrible. I mean, she wanted to debate Donald Trump more than Hillary Clinton wanted to debate Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cI have a hard time with these debates anyway because I don\u2019t know why we continue to walk into this maelstrom where we know we\u2019re going to be at least 2-on-1, 3-on-1, whatever the circumstances are,\u201d he complained. \u201cNo Republican is ever going to catch a \u00a0break from a moderator, so we already have it stacked against us. I thought last night that was very, very troubling and difficult. But it was the first 15 minutes I thought really cheated America out of a good opportunity to get on to the issues.\u201dBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.LISTEN:2016 Presidential Race, Hillary Clinton, Radio, 2016 presidential debates, Breitbart News Daily, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Republican Party, Sam ClovisComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

This is my first time, Alisyn, at the \u2014 at the national level. And the fact is that, you know, I \u2014 as I said on Saturday, you know, I couldn\u2019t condone, I couldn\u2019t defend those remarks. I encouraged Donald Trump on Friday to apologize for them. He did. He expressed his personal remorse.\u201dBut I also encouraged him Saturday to take that to the American people to show his heart. And when he said on national television he wasn\u2019t proud of it, he was embarrassed by it, I do believe that he expressed himself straight from his heart to the American people.\u00a0But \u2014 but then he moved on. And in the next 90 minutes, the American people saw a dramatic choice between someone who is speaking boldly about the challenges facing this country, and someone who, when their confronted with their own record, when they\u2019re confronted with the controversies unfurling out of the Clinton Foundation, or her speeches on Wall Street, just obfuscated or ignored or refused to respond. And I \u2014 I think in Donald Trump you\u2019ve got someone who\u2019s willing to step up, speak boldly and plainly from his heart and his mind and\u00a0Hillary Clinton, when she\u2019s confronted on speeches on Wall Street, she gave us a one minute lecture on Abraham Lincoln and never answered any of the questions that were posed.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Alisyn Camerota, CNN, Mike Pence, New DayComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

There's not a close second. https://t.co/b3Y4Y9wZqRby Jeff Poor10 Oct 20160Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d co-host Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski weighed in on the debate a night earlier between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Scarborough declared Trump to be the his most effective debate performance to date and theorized that Republicans that jumped ship from Trump\u2019s candidacy are wishing they had not at this point.\u201cI think despite what you think of Donald Trump, what you think of Hillary Clinton, what you think of how this race has gone over the weekend and where you think it\u2019s going to end up, whether you think last night made any difference at all to the final outcome in November,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cI think there are a couple of things that people in the press may not want to admit, but it was plainly evident watching it on TV last night. Number one, it was Donald Trump\u2019s most effective debate performance to date. There\u2019s not a close second. Just not a close second. Secondly, despite the fact she had an unprecedented cheering section in the media, the fact is for somebody watching and people will see this if they watch it again today or so parts of it a week from now or a month from now \u2013 Hillary Clinton was on the defensive most of the night.\u201d\u201cShe seemed unsure of herself most of the night and he dominated the second debate in the same way she dominated the first debate. And third, and I think most importantly for this political season, Donald Trump, who has made the Republican Party members lives living and breathing hells for the past year and a half, last night turned it up to 11. And all of those people that jumped ship about halfway through the debate were looking at their TV saying, \u2018Oh shoot.\u2019 Because \u2014 I know everybody in the press hates Donald Trump,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m giving you reality if you don\u2019t like it. He\u2019s horrible. I heard it last night. I saw it on Twitter. I understand. You believe he\u2019s an evil man. I\u2019m just giving you the political reality and this is the political reality \u2013 that for the Republican base, Donald Trump delivered the attack against the Clinton machine that the Republican base and Middle America have been waiting for years now.\u201d\u201cAnd so good luck being in Pensacola, FL, saying I\u2019m off of Donald Trump or saying in Kansas, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not for Donald Trump anymore,\u2019 especially when no Republican in America should have been surprised by what they heard on Friday,\u201d Scarborough added.Brzezinski seemed to agree, calling it \u201cvintage Trump.\u201d\u201cNo Republican in America could have done what he did last night,\u201d she sad. \u201cThey just \u2014 my god.

LOUIS, Missouri0Donald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential nominee, crushed his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton in Sunday evening\u2019s debate at Washington University in St. Louis\u2014propelling him closer to the White House and past, perhaps, the roughest stretch of his campaign yet.\u201cIt was an absolute home run for Mr. Trump,\u201d Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, told Breitbart News in the spin room after the debate. \u201cThis was a game-changing victory. You know what? The underdog is back.\u201dSeveral key exchanges in the debate proved Trump to be the better candidate on Sunday night, the most important of which was when\u00a0Trump forced out on his own with no help from moderators CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz: when Trump said he would appoint a special and independent prosecutor to investigate the Clinton email scandal.Trump held his own through six straight questions with which\u00a0Raddatz and others peppered him, opening the debate about the recently surfaced video of him using lewd language with former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s nephew Billy Bus; then when Hillary Clinton brought up the birther questions again\u2014trying to force that into the conversation\u2014Trump trapped her.\u201cHe [Trump] owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words,\u201d Clinton said, regarding the birther issue.After detailing how\u00a0it is actually Hillary Clinton who owes President Obama an apology because she started the birther narrative\u2014it\u2019s been proven that Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal pushed the story back in the 2008 campaign, as did at least two people on Clinton\u2019s campaign\u2014Trump shifted the conversation to questions about her emails.\u201cBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing,\u201d Trump said, before dropping the mega-bomb: a\u00a0special prosecutor to independently investigate Clinton. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor,\u201d Trump said, adding:When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where emails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been \u2014\u00a0destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.After Clinton accused Trump of \u201clies\u201d without detailing any, and as Raddatz attempted to intervene to save her, she begged the so-called \u201cfact checkers\u201d for help.\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d she added.In response, Trump fired back his most aggressive and bold comeback all year: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201dAnother key moment came when Raddatz tried to press Trump on his plan to temporarily halt Islamic migration into America from nations with terrorism problems. Hillary Clinton, in her previous answer\u2014in a response to an Islamophobia question from an audience member\u2014had attacked Trump over the Khan Gold Star family controversy again. Trump, in his reply to Raddatz\u2019s question, flipped the whole thing back on Clinton\u2014who, unlike Trump, supported the war in Iraq.\u201cFirst of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today because, unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo he would have been alive today.\u201d\u201cThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cHillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands\u2026\u201dRaddatz then interrupted him.\u201cExcuse me. Excuse me,\u201d Trump talked over her.\u201cAnd why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe\u2026\u201d Raddatz asked over Trump\u2019s talking.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time,\u201d Trump asked Raddatz, speaking directly at the moderator.\u201cI do,\u201d Raddatz said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you interrupt her?\u201d Trump followed up.The moderators interrupted Trump 26 times\u2014and Clinton only 12 times\u2014a clear and implicit bias by the legacy media anchors. \u201cWould you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\u201d Raddatz interjected again.\u201cIt\u2019s called extreme vetting,\u201d Trump said. He continued:We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values, and we know nothing about their love for our country.There were many other moments throughout the debate\u2014from exchanges on Obamacare to more about refugees to dealing with Russia and Syria and even campaign finance\u2014and\u00a0Trump defeated Clinton on all of them. After the moderators could not stump Trump in the opening, and he steamrolled ahead in the early momentum, she could not catch a break all night.Trump\u2019s debate victory\u2014which comes after a rough first debate with Clinton back on September 26, an eternity ago in this race, and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s win last Tuesday in Virginia in the vice presidential debate against\u00a0Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA)\u2014puts perhaps the roughest stretch of his campaign behind him. A videotape of him making lewd remarks about women surfaced on Friday, and jittery establishment Republicans showed initial signs of a full-scale collapse of support for him. That was followed by an apology video late Friday night from Trump, a WikiLeaks document dump of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s personal emails, a rough-and-tumble, but effective, showing from several women who have accused Bill Clinton of allegedly raping or sexually assaulting them, and now this debate performance. With each of those developments and more, Trump seems to have put that stage of the campaign behind him and returned to the offensive position\u2014riding high into political battle\u2014moving into the final month of the campaign.The videotape threatened to derail Trump\u2019s campaign, as it prompted several senior Republicans to call on him to withdraw and hand the nomination away to his running mate or someone else. Trump has doubled down and refuses to quit on his supporters\u2014and, sure enough, the tape found its way to center stage at the debate\u2019s opening. Trump was pressed on it a whopping six times before he finally\u2014as he hinted he would before the debate when tweeting out video interviews that Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers did with Breitbart News, then appearing with them at an event here in Missouri\u2014lit into Hillary Clinton for enabling Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior.But not only did Trump survive; he thrived. In the chaotic environment\u2014as he described it as \u201cone on three,\u201d with the moderators working to help Clinton far more than to help him\u2014Trump found his groove again and soared to a much-needed debate victory. The win not only stops the bleeding from a rough patch of the campaign, but propels him forward into the week like a cannonball onto the homestretch, with one final debate to go in Las Vegas a week from Wednesday. Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, noted that Trump does his best with his back against the wall.\u201cI think Donald Trump loves being the underdog, and this was fantastic,\u201d Miller told Breitbart News. \u201cI think what we saw tonight is a presidential leader in Donald Trump, who stepped up, is ready to lead, and that he\u2019s not going to back down to anybody. Hillary Clinton was rattled\u2014completely rattled\u2014the entire evening. She couldn\u2019t answer on crazy Obamacare. She couldn\u2019t answer on taxes. She couldn\u2019t answer on the emails. You could see everything, from her face was rattled to her inability to give clear answers to the voters who were there. I think if you\u2019re at home and you\u2019re watching, and you think about that person who is out there and what it would look like if she were across the table from a foreign leader, I\u2019d be nervous that she wouldn\u2019t be able to stand up and defend this country. I think one candidate came across as very presidential tonight and that was Donald Trump.\u201d2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton, 2016 presidential campaign, 2016 presidential election, Anderson Cooper, debate, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, martha raddatzComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Mr. Kassam talked about how Carswell has isolated himself from much of the rest of the regular membership of the party and his multiple instances of criticizing his own party leadership and its members.Kassam set down some ground rules in order for the MP to stay in the party saying that Mr. Carswell \u201cbehaved very badly now for several years,\u201d \u00a0and spoke directly to the MP saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t appear to have had the party\u2019s interests at heart. Your local branch is falling apart.\u201dOne tweet from Mr Carswell in particular caught the ire of Kassam. Carswell tweeted that the U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump had gone \u201cThanet South,\u201d an allusion to the last British general election. Then UKIP leader Nigel Farage had run in the constituency of South Thanet, and did not win, though there were several reports\u00a0of dubious activities after the result.It's all going a bit South Thanet for the US Republicans, I see?   https://t.co/dYER2GLCAI\u2014 Douglas Carswell MP (@DouglasCarswell) August 24, 2016One of the biggest problems for Kassam is the control Carswell has over the \u201cshort money\u201d \u2013 tax payer funding which Carswell receives for being a member of parliament in an opposition party. According to Kassam the money would be better spent by giving it over to the central party who could then employ their own researchers in London and helping branches across the country, rather than Carswell monopolizing it and using his own research team.The composition of Carswell\u2019s research team is also a hot issue for Kassam who accuses Carswell of using Conservative Party members in his team, rather than solely researchers from UKIP.The next ground rule laid down by Kassam was the need for Carswell to publicly apologise for his treatment of members of UKIP including the leadership and the supporters. Carswell has been a constant critic of the UKIP leadership of Nigel Farage and speculation has led some to believe that his actions were part of a plot\u00a0to \u201cneutralise\u201d the growing popularity of Mr. Farage.The final rule mentioned by Kassam was a contract that Carswell must sign indicating that he was\u00a0never to engage in negativity toward his own\u00a0political party or its members, supporters and officials ever again. \u201cAnd if you break the contract, Douglas\u2026 bye bye,\u201d Kassam said.Many live stream followers indicated that Mr. Carswell was unlikely to do any of these things, a point which Kassam stressed would therefore be grounds enough for his explusion.The ground rules follow on the comments\u00a0by Kassam last week on CNN in which he said that it was time for UKIP to \u201cgrow up\u201d as a party. He described the propositions to solve the problem with Carswell by saying he was only, \u201cputting in basic ground rules like grown ups do.\u201dBreitbart editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam announced after the sudden resignation of UKIP leader Diane James that he would run for the leadership of the party under the slogan \u201cMake UKIP great again.\u201d Kassam wants to see more direct democracy within the party who he says need to take over the opposition spot from the Labour Party who are losing much of their traditional working class voter base in the aftermath of Brexit.Breitbart London, UKIP, douglas carswell, raheem kassam, ukip, UKIP leadership contestComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Yet not doing so would undermine the claim that leaving the EU would enable Britain to take back control of her borders.To get around the problem, Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has suggested that Britain could work with Ireland to strengthen her external borders to combat illegal immigration once Britain withdraws from the EU. The two countries already collect passenger information from those passing through customs; it is envisaged that the information would be shared freely between the two.Speaking to The Guardian, he said \u201cWe have put in place a range of measures to further combat illegal migration working closely with the Irish government.\u201cOur focus is to strengthen the external border of the common travel area, building on the strong collaboration with our Irish partners.\u201dThere is a precedent for the two counties working together on immigration: currently, the citizens of 16 countries including China and India can apply for a visa which grants them access to both countries. It has been suggested that this could be extended.Mr. Brokenshire said: \u201cWe are already working closely with the Irish government and other members of the common travel area to prevent people from seeking to evade UK immigration controls from entering via another part of the CTA.\u201cThere is a high level of collaboration on a joint programme of work. This includes investment in border procedures; increased data sharing to inform immigration and border security decisions; passenger data systems enabling the collection and processing of advance passenger information; and harmonised visa processes.\u201dThe scheme would leave the UK vulnerable to EU immigration as EU citizens would still have the right to travel freely into Ireland to live and work if they so wished. This raises the possibility of EU citizens using Ireland as a springboard to move to the UK.But Dan Mulhall, the Irish ambassador to Britain, has dismissed this as an issue. He recently told the House of Lords: \u201cFor as long as Ireland is not part of Schengen [The EU\u2019s borderless zone], everyone coming into Ireland from continental Europe and beyond has to go through passport control at our airports and ports.\u201cTherefore, the only people who will have the right of free movement into Ireland and the right to live, work, visit and settle in Ireland will be European Union citizens.\u201cIt is, of course, true that an EU citizen could come to Ireland after Brexit, settle in Ireland and then decide to go across the border to Northern Ireland and then to Britain, but they would be illegal immigrants. As I understand, most Europeans are not interested in being illegal in any European country It seems to me that only a relatively small number of European Union citizens would want to come to the UK illegally.\u201dA spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May commented: \u201cThe open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has undoubtedly served both people and businesses extremely well.\u201cThere is a very strong commitment between the UK government and the Northern Ireland executive to see that remains the case, that there is no return to the borders of the past.\u201cWork is ongoing to strengthen that relationship in the future.\u201dBreitbart London, border control, Brexit, free movement of people, Good Friday Agreement, Ireland, ShengenComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The camp is due for demolition in the next few weeks.Speaking to KentOnline, Mr. Burton recounted: \u201cWe take our staff and friends on a day trip across the Channel, to Bruges or Belgium or France, often a few times a year.\u201cIt was a great day out until we started our return journey to Calais.\u201cWe were about a mile from the port at about 9pm and the road was suddenly blocked by a load of people with hoods and covered faces. I have no doubt that they were refugees.\u201cThey were banging on the windows, hitting the car and trying to get in, shouting and screaming at us.\u201cLisa was driving and she was blowing on her horn and driving slowly through, but who knows what would have happened if she had stopped.\u201dWhen Mr. Burton approached French Border Control to report the incident, they shrugged it off, saying that such incidents were not uncommon. They said that many go unreported\u00a0and that a coach recently had all its windows smashed out.\u201cObviously it would be different if something like this happened here, someone would be arrested, but we have decided not to take it any further because it was on French soil and we are not sure what police would do anyway,\u201d Mr. Burton added.\u201cThe situation in Calais is clearly completely out of control.\u201cWe often go over to France on the ferry, two or three times a year, and we know a lot of others who do the same, but now we have seen what can happen on the other side, we will think twice before going back, and we hope others do too.\u201dMrs. Burton added that she had been terrified by the events, and has vowed not to return to France again until the situation is remedied.\u201cWe all just gasped as soon as we saw the group and some of the older ones in the car were really upset as it was terrifying,\u201d she said.\u201cI don\u2019t know what they thought they could achieve by acting in this way. They are desperate, I know, and maybe angry that we could get to England so easy and they couldn\u2019t but why did they think that by attacking and scaring us, this could help them?\u201cWe won\u2019t be returning until we know we are safe to travel around Calais and we want people to be aware of the situation. Imagine if we had children in the car?\u201cThe ferry may be cheap at \u00a319 a crossing, but it\u2019s not worth it when you are at risk of this.\u201dThe incident is merely the latest in a string of attacks on vehicles passing through Calais. Locals have been warning each other to avoid certain roads after migrants amused themselves by smashing up vehicles waiting in traffic, while truck drivers have repeatedly warned of the danger they face from migrants attempting to board their lorries.On Sunday an Eritrean man was killed while attempting to block the A16 road near Calais in order to slow traffic.

They are just there for the pleasure of the man, and even more so if they are unbelievers.\u201dSpeaking about her years of aid work in Muslim countries, the sister recalled how she\u2019d listen as women cried about wounds to their breasts and genitals. \u201cAll atrocities committed in the name of Allah,\u201d Sister Hatune told the audience, adding: \u201cNot since yesterday but for centuries.\u201dAs the Order of Merit recipient recounted how people she helped in the Middle East told her that Islamic State terrorists would strike \u201cinfidel\u201d babies against a rock \u201cuntil there was no more head\u201d, an audience member cried out for Sister Hatune to stop.The woman told the nun the terrorists are \u201ca picture of Germany\u2019s own past\u201d and that Germans learned they must live with people of other religions, Baden Online reported.Sister Hatune warned the audience of false tolerance and cowardice, stating: \u201cThe door must remain open to genuine refugees, but not for those who want to revolutionise our society. If we remain silent, our entire future will be ruined.\u201dBorn in a small Christian village in Eastern Turkey, Sister Hatune fled to Germany with her parents and siblings at the age of 14 after Muslim neighbours threatened to kill her father for his religion.A few years later, after joining a Syrian-Orthodox monastery, and training in nursing and to be a school teacher, the Turkish nun began her 25 years of working to help the most persecuted and helpless people in Muslim countries.Dr Phyllis Chesler has written for Breitbart News about some of the work the sister and her charity, the Hatune Foundation, have done rescuing Christian and Yazidi girls from the clutches of Islamic State in Iraq.Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart London, Faith, Christians genocide, Christians in Middle East, ISIS, persecuted Christians, YazidiComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Last month, the popular right-wing Pepe the Frog meme was added to the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Hate Symbol Database, opening the way for its use to be classed as a hate crime.The UK guidelines also specifies that \u201cthose who encourage others to commit a communications offence may be charged: for instance, encouragement to tweet or re-tweet a grossly offensive message, or the creation of a derogatory hashtag, or making available personal information (doxing), so that individuals can more easily be targeted by others\u201d.Adding: \u201cSuch encouragement may sometimes lead to a campaign of harassment or \u2018virtual mobbing\u2019 or \u2018dog-piling\u2019, whereby a number of individuals use social media or messaging to disparage another person, usually because they are opposed to that person\u2019s opinions.\u201dAny \u201ccommunications which\u2026 may be considered grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false\u201d will be criminalised under Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988, it is stated. The maximum sentence for the social media offences is 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, although this can rise if there is evidence of threatening behaviour.The Malicious Communications Act has already been used to jail teenagers for posting offensive messages on Facebook. In another notorious case, a man was put on trial under the Act after he posted a joke bomb threat on Twitter.The new guidelines acknowledge that protecting free speech and jokes, and avoiding abuses of the laws to silence debate, is an issue.The document says comments have to pass a \u201chigh threshold\u201d and police should not prosecute people for comments which are considered \u201csatirical\u201d or \u201cbanter and humour\u201d.The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Alison Saunders, commented: \u201cSocial media can be used to educate, entertain and enlighten but there are also people who use it to bully, intimidate and harass.\u201cIgnorance is not a defence and perceived anonymity is not an escape. Those who commit these acts, or encourage others to do the same, can and will be prosecuted.\u201dMrs. Saunders also boasted: \u201cOur latest Hate Crime Report showed that in 2015-16 more hate crime prosecutions were completed than ever before. More than four in five prosecuted hate crimes result in a conviction; with over 73 per cent guilty pleas.\u201dIn August, it was reported that the London Mayor had set up a new police \u201chate crime hub\u201d staffed by \u201ca dedicated police team\u201d backed by \u201cvolunteers\u201d who will monitor social media full time for so-called \u201chate crimes\u201d and \u201ctrolls\u201d to criminalise.Breitbart London, Alison Saunders, cencorship, Doxing, facebook, free speech, hate speech, internet trolling, Social Media, TwitterComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

That\u2019s because, though I had heard her red-meat opening speech in which she promised to deliver us the \u201cFull\u00a0English Brexit not\u00a0the Continental croissants-and-coffee version\u201d (as my colleague Charles Moore\u00a0so brilliantly put it), what I hadn\u2019t heard were all the subsequent speeches in which she and her senior cabinet colleagues outlined their plans to turn Britain into a fiscally reckless, micromanagerial, inward-looking Big Government paradigm, rather than the free-booting, small state, outward looking trading state some of us had dearly hoped it might be. More on this in another column.One quick final thought though: that awful speech by Amber Rudd \u2013 even after you\u2019ve pinched yourself, really hard, you\u2019ll find to your amazement that she still holds the office of Home Secretary \u2013 where she announced plans to name and shame\u00a0any British companies that employed too many foreign workers, earning comparisons with Mein Kampf.Was there ever a public statement better calculated to make Britain\u2019s exit from the EU as unpleasant, heavily-resisted and difficult as possible? If you didn\u2019t know better \u2013 I\u2019m sure it was down to cock-up, paucity of talent and grotesque overpromotion \u2013 you\u2019d almost think it was a deliberate act of sabotage design to make Brexiteers look like a bunch of Nazis\u2026Breitbart London, Breitbart TV, Amber Rudd, BBC, Brexit, Bruges Group, conservatives, EU referendum, Theresa MayComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The French cardinals told the CFCM that the Pope had particularly appreciated the institution\u2019s firm positions following the murder of Father Jacques Hamel on July 26 in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray by two terrorists belonging to the Islamic State.The CFCM delegation will travel to Rome on November 2 for a reception at France\u2019s embassy in Rome. On November 3, they will meet with the Vatican Cardinal in charge of relations with Islam, followed by the private audience with Pope Francis.France has been particularly hard hit by attacks from Islamic terrorists. Besides the execution of Father Hamel, militants of the Islamic State have carried out two major attacks in Paris, as well as the slaughter of 84 civilians in the south of France as they celebrated Bastille Day.Follow Thomas D.

Leipzig is around 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Chemnitz, where he had evaded authorities on Saturday and where authorities found explosives.Police were informed that fellow Syrians were holding the suspect at an apartment in Leipzig, and \u201cimmediately went there and arrested him,\u201d Saxony police spokesman Tom Bernhardt said.He added that police aren\u2019t giving further details \u201cbecause we do not want to provoke any dangers for those persons who gave us the tip.\u201dAlbakr, who comes from the Damascus area, escaped authorities on Saturday when they raided an apartment in Chemnitz.

Police fired a warning shot but were unable to stop him.German media have reported that Albakr is believed to be connected to Islamic extremist groups, but Saxony police have not commented on his possible motive or the bomb plot\u2019s target.The explosives were destroyed Saturday in a controlled detonation by bomb squad experts in a pit dug outside the five-story apartment building because they were considered too dangerous to transport.In July, two attacks carried out by asylum seekers and claimed by the Islamic State group, in which multiple people were injured and the assailants were killed, put Germany on edge \u2014 along with two other attacks unrelated to Islamic extremism, including a deadly mall shooting in Munich.Authorities say Albakr came to Germany in the flood of 890,000 migrants who entered the country in 2015 and had been granted asylum.During the manhunt, federal police had increased security around the country, particularly around facilities such as train stations and airports.Breitbart London, Europe Migrant Crisis, Germany Migrants, migrant terror attacks, Syrian migrantsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But it raised fears among others that she had cornered herself into a total break with the bloc.The German chancellor, French president and heads of EU institutions in Brussels took a common line that May\u2019s demands to be free to bar EU immigrants and escape oversight by EU courts mean Britain cannot stay inside the EU single market.That, EU officials say, means a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, with London\u2019s best option perhaps a free trade deal, maybe a little better than a current EU offer to Canada.President Hollande endorsed the term \u201chard Brexit\u201d last week, making clear that if that is what Britons want, France will \u201cpush this wish through\u201d and ensure Britain ends up truly out.May hopes for \u201cpreparatory work\u201d with her EU counterparts to smooth the launch of formal talks. British officials want \u201cpre-negotiations\u201d before she writes to trigger the two-year exit process under Article 50 of the EU treaty.If her initial demands are rejected out of hand, she may have little domestic political room to water them down.\u201cPRE-PARATION\u201d?The EU mantra is \u201cno negotiation before notification\u201d. On Friday, Commission President Juncker said: \u201cWe won\u2019t negotiate before we\u2019ve had the British government\u2019s farewell letter.\u201d (The French term he used also means \u201csuicide note\u201d.)But May\u2019s pledge of a March deadline has eased concerns any talks would simply let the British keep talking without suffering the jeopardy inherent in Article 50\u2019s two-year time frame.One senior EU diplomat said setting a date for starting talks meant leaders would now be ready to \u201chelp\u201d May frame British demands before she writes her letter: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call that pre-negotiation but, perhaps, pre-paration,\u201d he said.A senior EU official said London may get \u201cpositive noises\u201d on what others can accept before the fateful letter: \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cIt will always be a leap into at least half darkness.\u201dBritish officials and politicians also talk of using economic muscle to secure concessions from other Europeans \u2014 whether poor eastern states which might put British offers of cash to help maintain EU subsidies before the migration rights of their citizens, or German carmakers keen to keep a market.That, argue EU diplomats and officials, may be to mistake the resolve of European leaders not just to defend their own economic interests but to prevent Britain securing a sweetheart deal that might encourage eurosceptic populism at home.\u201cMany Brexiters claim that the toughness of the 27 is merely an opening stance, and that, when talks commence, economic self-interest will push them to soften,\u201d wrote Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform. \u201cBut that may be wishful thinking.\u201dBRIDGES AND TRANSITIONSThe past week saw EU leaders line up to defend a hard line.\u201cIf we don\u2019t say full access to the internal market is linked to full freedom of movement, then a movement will spread in Europe where everyone just does whatever they want,\u201d Chancellor Merkel told German industrial leaders in Berlin, telling them she would not be pressured by sectional interests.Juncker was clearer still about a need to be \u201cintransigent\u201d to counter British lobbying: \u201cWe cannot have whole sections of European industry conducting secret talks in darkened rooms behind closed doors with envoys of the British government.\u201dMany British and some European officials say the freedom of movement of labour is not essential in economic terms to a common market in goods, services and capital. The EU messaging of the past week aims to show that it is essential politically.Even if governments might cut London slack on migration, the federalist European Parliament whose blessing any deal needs is unlikely to soften. A British push to evade EU courts but stay in the single market seems an even longer shot to EU officials.Juncker\u2019s Brexit negotiator, former French minister Michel Barnier, started work a week ago and will tour the 27 capitals to sound out the varying priorities of member states. Barnier\u2019s deputy Sabine Weyand, a German Commission staffer and expert on trade, is preparing for some of the toughest aspects of Brexit.Aides to EU summit chair Donald Tusk, led by Belgian diplomat Didier Seeuws, have already spent three months mapping out issues and procedures to run such complex, lengthy talks.Officials think they can wrap up the basics of divorce, such as dividing up shared assets and liabilities by 2019, but some kind of transition deal will also have to be struck as it will take years more to conclude a complete new trading relationship.They are working out how those two sets of talks can run in parallel: \u201cBridges and transitions will be pretty tricky,\u201d said one. \u201cIf you want to avoid disruption this will be the key.\u201dBreitbart London, Brexit, Brexit negotiationsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The report is said to note that since 2001 nearly all ter\u00adror plots in Britain have involved Islam\u00adists; the only hate mur\u00adders of Brit\u00adish Mus\u00adlims in the past three years were com\u00admitted by other Muslims such as the murder of moderate Ahmadi Muslim Asad Shah by a Sunni Muslim for \u201cdisrespecting Islam\u201d.Senior Home Office official Charlie Edwards has told a number of anti-extremism professionals in recent weeks that Ms. Casey\u2019s report will be \u201cdramatically\u201d rewritten and launched in a much \u201clower-key\u201d way than had been planned.Those who had spoken to Mr. Edwards, who is the advisor to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, told The Sunday Times that he wanted the report \u201cgutted\u201d and that the Home Office was trying to find a way to \u201cwater it down\u201d.Last year Ms. Casey, who is known to be outspoken on social issues, lambasted Rotherham council for its \u201cresolute denial\u201d and \u201cdeep-rooted\u201d culture of cover-ups in an official report on the grooming and sexual abuse of 1,400 children by\u00a0Muslim gangs.In July, the integration tsar said that\u00a0it was \u201cnot racist to say that the pace and rate of immigration\u00a0has\u00a0created a lot of change in Britain and for some people that feels too much\u201d, adding that that the government needs to be \u201cmuch bolder\u201d in celebrating British history, culture, and heritage.Ms. Casey was unavailable for comment, but she did tell one person: \u201cDon\u2019t ask an old big beast to write something if you don\u2019t want a big beast. Find yourself a puppet, find yourself a muppet if that\u2019s what you want.\u201dIn response, the Home Office refused to deny claims that the report was being censored, stating only that it would be published \u201cin due course\u201d.Breitbart London, Immigration, government censorship, home office, integration, Mass Migration, radical islamComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

German news agency DPA, citing security sources, reported that Albakr had links to the Islamic State (IS) group.Police said \u201cseveral hundred grams\u201d of an \u201cexplosive substance even more dangerous than TNT\u201d were found in Albakr\u2019s apartment in the eastern city of Chemnitz, about 260 kilometres south of Berlin.\u201cEven a small quantity of this substance could have caused enormous damage,\u201d police said.Three people with links to Albakr, who arrived in Germany last year as a refugee, have been arrested in Chemnitz.Heavily-armed officers, some wearing balaclavas, carried out a vast operation in the neighbourhood where Albakr had been living.Around 100 local residents were evacuated from the area, and a loud explosion was heard in the leafy suburb as police forced their way into the apartment with an entry device.Germany has been on edge after suffering two attacks claimed by IS in July \u2014 an axe rampage on a train in Wuerzburg that injured five and a suicide bombing in Ansbach that left 15 wounded.Those two attacks rattled Germans\u2019 sense of security and fuelled concerns over the country\u2019s record influx of nearly 900,000 migrants and refugees last year.\u2013 Under surveillance \u2013In Chemnitz, part of the city\u2019s main station was sealed off by officers as a remote-controlled robot was deployed to inspect a suspect package on a platform which turned out to be harmless.Police destroyed the explosives found in the apartment in specially-dug holes on land nearby.Albakr had been under surveillance for some time, with the magazine Focus reporting that he was suspected of plotting to attack an airport.Two of his associates were arrested close to Chemnitz\u2019s railway station while a third was taken into custody in the city centre. A package belonging to one of those arrested was undergoing analysis, police added.\u201cThey were known to the suspect we are looking for and were arrested and detained,\u201d said Bernhardt, who added that the trio were being questioned.Albakr was living in a neighbourhood of Chemnitz whose communist-era housing estates are home to many recently arrived refugees.Police in the state of Saxony, where the city is located, issued a search warrant for Albakr after officers received information from domestic intelligence services, a police spokesman said, saying he was born in Syria in January 1994.They added that Albakr was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and was \u201csuspected of preparing a bomb attack\u201d, issuing an image of the man.\u201cAt present we do not know where (the suspect) is or what he is carrying,\u201d police said on Twitter, urging residents to be cautious.\u2013 Security threats \u2013German police said previously they had identified 523 people who posed a security threat to the country, around half of whom were known to be currently in Germany.On September 21 German officials said a 16-year-old Syrian refugee had been arrested on suspicion of planning a bomb attack in the name of IS.The youngster, thought to have been radicalised only recently, was detained in a special forces operation at a shelter for asylum seekers in the western city of Cologne, police and prosecutors said.Initial information gathered from the teenager\u2019s mobile phone showed that he had expressed an \u201cunmistakeable willingness\u201d to carry out an attack, Klaus-Stephan Becker of the Cologne police told reporters.A week earlier, German police detained three men with forged Syrian passports accused of being IS militants and labelled a possible \u201csleeper cell\u201d with links to the assailants behind the November attacks in Paris.More than 200 police took part in pre-dawn raids in northern Germany to detain the men, suspected of either plotting an attack or awaiting orders to commit one.German authorities have urged the public not to confuse migrants with \u201cterrorists\u201d, but have acknowledged that more jihadists may have entered the country among the nearly one million asylum seekers who arrived last year.Breitbart London, Europe Migrant Crisis, Germany Migrants, Islamic State in Europe, Jihad in Europe, Syrian migrantsComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.\u201dSince HNA drew attention to the issue yesterday, Catholics and church figures have criticised the attitude of Sara Nussbaum House towards Christian festivals as part of a growing trend.Marita Gill, president of a Catholic nursery school, said that while 92 of the 98 children enrolled there have a migration background, they all enthusiastically celebrate Christmas. Ms. Gill said the children who attend St Boniface daycare centre, from 28 different nations, are \u201crarely so excited\u201d as when hearing Christmas stories during Advent.Ms. Gill said she often hears that Christian festivals now barely play a role at state daycare centres. She told HNA: \u201cThis is our culture, we must not lie [about it] or change it.\u201dPublic nurseries increasingly dropping Christian culture and festivals was reportedly much discussed at this week\u2019s Catholic City Conference.Conference chairman Marie Louise Labrie opined: \u201cKindergartens are places of integration. But there is clearly a confusion about what tolerance is.\u201d She said: \u201cOne must first recognise their own Christian culture and make sure they then can also appreciate other cultures.\u201dAsserting that Christmas is not only a cultural marker but also one of faith, Ms. Labrie added: \u201cWe should show the Muslim children what we find beautiful about Christmas. Conversely, they can show us in kindergarten what makes their religion special, like Ramadan for example.\u201dThe dean of the Catholic Church in Kassel, Harald Fischer, also contributed to the discussion on Christian values in daycare centres. He said: \u201cIntegration does not mean that we hide our Christian values behind alleged tolerance and multiculturalism.\u201dSaying he feared the topic could be \u201cexploited\u201d by right-wing parties, the dean added: \u201cMuslims are not the problem, but rather daycare centres who hide Christian traditions in anticipatory obedience.\u201dAnne Janz, the councillor responsible for youth affairs in Kassel, said parents should have taken their complaints directly to Sara Nussbaum House rather than contacting the press. Defending the practice of marginalising Christian festivals, the Green party politician insisted public nurseries make sure to \u201cconvey the core values of our Western Christian culture\u201d.Ms. Jantz said: \u201cWe do not conduct religious instruction, instead we have a\u00a0comfortable discussion of our values of solidarity, charity, sharing, and justice.

And in that vein, he followed through Chicago and New York, with each speech and interview leaving less and less doubt that he indeed was there primarily to engage in the former US First Lady\u2019s comeback campaign, to eventually sign off at the annual Clinton Foundation party and then fly back to the UK.Feeling compelled to keep the new London Mayor in check as his unlikely former competitor for the parliamentary seat of Tooting (which he ditched just six days after being elected to run for the current job), I advised not to raise the hopes too high even before he crossed the pond. And after a number of gaffes\u00a0and bad publicity, I questioned on Breitbart\u2019s Sirius XM whether his trip was at all good value for money from the taxpayers\u2019 perspective.As I remarked, the purpose of the trip was advertised to us here as showing Americans that \u201cLondon is open for business and should remain a key destination for North American investment\u201d. Instead Sadiq Khan\u2019s trip made the news for repeated expressions of support for Hillary Clinton and continuous bashing of the potential future American President Donald Trump\u2026 Hardly good for business!And to seal the bad taste left by breaching diplomatic protocol, the Chicago papers picked up on Mayor\u2019s connection to the\u00a0famous anti-Semite, Nation of Islam\u2019s Louis\u00a0Farrakhan on the eve of his arrival in the city, which ensured that only the craziest of mad CEOs would at that stage want anything to do with him \u2014 or London.I made a point on Sirius XM that I was becoming worried the overall value-added effect of his trip, resulting from all these mishaps and shenanigans, on our great capital city might be negative. The lost opportunities and businesses pulling out over time are obviously hard to quantify. However, what could\u00a0be checked was the direct cost to the taxpayers.And so, I obtained the full cost of the trip for the London Mayor and his staff from the London City Hall, which came to \u00a339,806. To put that figure in a perspective, the average UK salary in 2016 was \u00a327,600, meaning that a reasonably well-paid individual could have been put in charge of promoting London to the USA for a period of a year instead. Given the major beneficiary of that disastrous trip was Hillary Clinton, we should really be billing these costs to her campaign.\u201cAlea iacta est\u201d (The die is cast) \u2013 the London Mayor chose to campaign for Hillary Clinton, and did so at London taxpayers\u2019 expense.

To qualify for permanent residency, EU migrants must have lived in Britain for five years.In a potentially controversial move, the department is set to grant amnesty to the 600,000 EU nationals who don\u2019t qualify.A senior source at the Home Office told the Telegraph: \u201cThe remaining people will, of course, be allowed to stay in the UK. That\u2019s a given. We just need to work out exactly how we do it.\u201dWhile the government maintains it is still committed to reduce immigration to \u201cthe tens of thousands\u201d, former borders chief Rob Whiteman has revealed illegal migration is out of control and very little is being done about it.Noting that 84,000 illegal entrants were caught in the UK last year, Mr Whiteman said this figure was \u201cat best\u201d just half the number who managed to slip in.He explained: \u201cIt is not unreasonable to assume that the number detected is only a proportion of the number trying. I would have thought the number caught is at best half.\u201cThe border is porous beyond our main ports. Britain is incredibly close to the rest of Europe so people will gain entry into the country through little harbours, inlets and airfields which are often not covered routinely.\u201cIf you have the money I suspect it\u2019s easy to get into the UK. The agency has three cutters. Your chances of getting across the Channel are good. In Australia a great deal of the navy\u2019s time is given over to border protection,\u201d he added.Mr Whiteman, who was chief executive of the UK Border Agency from 2011 to 2013, also disclosed that resources are used to target high-risk foreigners while other illegal immigrants are largely left alone.Just 5,810 foreigners illegally in the UK were removed last year, while asylum claims \u2014 77, 440 of which are currently in progress \u2014 are at their highest level since 2004.Mr Whiteman stated: \u201cThe number of illegal migrants reaching the country is far greater than the rate at which we are deporting people.\u201cEither we have to put considerable new resources and policies into removal, including holding more people in detention, or accept there are a large number of people living in the country who are not allowed to live here but neither are they facing deportation.\u201dWorking at the Home Office under Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr Whiteman was forced to slash the \u00a32 billion budget by a quarter.\u201cIf the public is ever going to be reassured we have to talk about the fact that there is a large amount of illegal migration that is not being dealt with.\u201cEither the Home Office needs more staff or we accept the situation isn\u2019t going away,\u201d he said.Border, Breitbart London, Immigration, Brexit, EU migrants, illegal immigration, UK Border Agency, UK Home OfficeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Left-wing activists held their own, smaller rally to welcome the migrants.Gendarmes stood watch but the morning gatherings were peaceful. The far-right National Front plans its own anti-migrant protest later in the day.The National Front is urging mayors to resist the Calais relocation plan and is organizing or taking part in protests across the country this month. Resistance to immigration is central to the campaign platform of National Front leader Marine Le Pen in her bid for the French presidency in elections next year.National Front politicians were also present at a protest Saturday in Forges-les-Bains south of Paris. About 200 people marched through town, past the farmers\u2019 market, school and town hall to protest the recent arrival of about 40 Afghan migrants relocated from Calais to an unused building in the center of town.President Francois Hollande has pledged to close the Calais camp before winter and relocate as many as 9,000 migrants living there to 164 sites around France while they\u2019re cases are examined. The Calais camp has been an embarrassment to the French government and symbol of Europe\u2019s failure to find solutions to the migrant crisis.Pierrefeu residents hostile to the migrants say they fear the newcomers will threaten security, and worry about potential tensions with the psychiatric patients.\u201cEven if we can understand the dismantling of Calais \u2026 our small towns are not the solution for this dismantling. We are too small to host so many people,\u201d said Mayor Patrick Martinelli.

The bear was so close they could hear it breathing.At first, the other kids didn\u2019t believe their cousin when she said a polar bear was nearby. And then they started running\u00a0\u2014 and so did the \u201cever big\u201d\u00a0polar bear.\u201cThat polar bear started running towards them,\u201d said Kikoak. \u201cAnd one of my twins, she was maybe about six feet away from the stairs [of the house], but she was so in shock to see that polar bear,\u00a0she was just standing there looking at it. And it didn\u2019t move. It kept on staring at her.\u201dKikoak said\u00a0her niece, who was inside the house with her and the rest of the children, thought fast and grabbed a skipping rope. She then tossed one\u00a0end to Kikoak\u2019s\u00a0six-year-old\u00a0daughter, who was still frozen in shock.The young girl held onto the end of the rope, said Kikoak, and was\u00a0pulled towards the house.\u201cAnd once she reached the stairs [my niece] grabbed her by her jacket and put her on the stairs,\u201d Kikoak said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how she saved my daughter.\u201dEarlier in September, in a different part of the Arctic, a group of five Russian researchers on Troynoy Island were besieged by a group of a dozen\u00a0ravenous adult polar bears which ate one of their dogs and caused them to run out of flares. A helicopter had to rescue them with a supply of more flares \u2013 and three puppies to replace the eaten hound. They weren\u2019t allowed guns because Russian law forbids the killing of polar bears because \u2013 supposedly \u2013 they are an endangered species.Meanwhile, in Svalbard, Norway \u2013 where polar bear populations have increased by 42 per cent since 2004 \u2013 polar bears are becoming an increasing problem in inhabited areas, with more and more having to be shot to protect humans.\u201cFour polar bears have been shot so far this year,\u201d Vidar Arnesen, a chief police inspector for the governor of Svalbard, told Reuters. \u201cIn a normal year, one or two would be shot.\u201d\u201cThere are more contacts between humans and the animals,\u201d he said aboard the Polarsyssel, the governor\u2019s ship, used for inspections and rescue operations.\u201dSvalbard was the site of a horrific incident in 2011 when Horatio Chapple, an English schoolboy on an expedition organised by the British Schools Exploring Society was killed in his tent by a\u00a0marauding bear. The bear mauled and wounded four other adventurers before it was finally shot.Polar bears, as we know, have a special status as the poster children of the manmade global warming \u201cit\u2019s all our fault and the planet is doomed due to our selfishness, greed and refusal to amend our carbon-guzzling lifestyles\u201d movement.But despite the best efforts of environmentalists to have the bear classified as \u201cEndangered\u201d, it remains stubbornly one notch below on the IUCN Red List in the merely \u201cVulnerable\u201d category.Even this, though, is probably an exaggeration. As even the (uber green) IUCN was forced to admit last year, polar bear populations are not declining.Indeed, in the last fifty years their population has increased five- or six-fold from around 5,000 to between 22,000 and 31,000.Just like global warming theory, the entire greenie case for the polar bear being in any kind of danger rests not on real life observations but on computer modelled projections and idle speculation.With polar bears, the theory runs that declining summer sea ice is depriving them of their hunting territory, causing them either to starve to death or drown on their desperate hunt for food. This theory is nonsense, for a number of reasons outlined here, including the facts that polar bears are excellent swimmers and that there has been no evidence to corroborate this theory \u2013 quite the opposite, in fact, with some populations appearing to benefit from shorter sea ice seasons. In any case, even if it were a problem, the Arctic is currently on a freezing trend not a warming one.A far bigger threat to polar bears \u2013 and to humans too \u2013 is that their populations are simply too healthy. This means that there is inevitably going to be an excess of young males foraging further afield for food, as polar bear expert Susan Crockford explains.In the polar bear entry for the encyclopedia, \u201cWild Mammals of North America,\u201d Steven Amstrup wrote (2003:602):\u201c\u2026 Age structure data show that subadults aged 2-5years survive at lower rates than adults, probably because they are still learning hunting and survival skills.\u201d\u2026\u201cI once observed a 3-year-old subadult that weighed only 70 kg in November. This was near the end of the autumn period in which Beaufort Sea bears reach their peak weights, and his cohorts at that time weighed in excess of 200 kg. This young animal apparently had not learned the skills needed to survive and was starving to death.\u201d [my bold]All this means the last line of this article is indeed true:\u201cThe possibilities of a hungry bear encountering a human being are increasing,\u201d said Lambertini.More problems with young males is what living with a healthy population of polar bears looks like, which means more bears will have to be shot in self-defense.Experts have been predicting this problem for some time. It has nothing to do with global warming and almost everything to do with the near-worldwide ban on polar bear hunting, which hitherto kept populations in manageable numbers.Ian Stirling, 1974:\u201cDr. Stirling felt that complete cessation of hunting, such as exists in Norway, may increase bear-man conflicts. Dr. Reimers replied that the careful harvesting of polar bears was probably desirable, but the total ban now in effect was largely an emotional and political decision rather than a biological one. Last year four bears were killed in self-defense.\u201d [my bold]\n(1974 PBSG meeting \u201cNorway \u2013 progress reported by [Thor] Larsen\u201d; Anonymous 1976:11).Stephen Amstrup, 2013:\u201cWe have predicted in no uncertain times [sic \u2013 terms?] that as bears become hungrier as the sea ice absence period is longer, more and more of these animals are going to be venturing into communities, venturing into villages, raiding food caches, getting into garbage, and even attacking people. So we predict these kinds of events are going to be more frequent and more severe because of climate change.\u201d [my bold]\n(The Guardian, November 4, 2013).Crockford is the author of a Jaws-style thriller on ravenous polar bears killing humans called Eaten.\u00a0At least one polar scientist who has read it considers its \u201cscience-based scenario\u201d to be frighteningly plausible.In field-level polar bear management circles, people don\u2019t talk about the kind of scenario that forms the premise of this novel as an \u201cif\u201d. Instead, they describe it as a \u201cwhen\u201d and they are not looking forward to it.Eek.Breitbart London, Environment, Arctic, canada, Eaten, Horatio Chapple, polar bears, sea ice, Susan Crockford, svalbard, TuktoyaktukComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

That is: not talking about reality. If they don\u2019t talk about reality, others will. That\u2019s the name of the game.I\u00a0believe it\u2019s all in everyone\u2019s interest in Europe to have honest, frank, political forces in a country, responsible political parties who talk about the truth, who talk about the reality on the ground because that\u2019s the only way to understand the nature of the problem.He noted the challenge of trying to be open about migration because the press, according to Kov\u00e1cs\u2026is going to describe you as, let\u2019s say, \u2018unorthodox\u2019 or write immediately that you\u2019re a Nazi or a far-right representative of the political spectrum.It\u2019s about migration but also it\u2019s about economic issues and others. So we\u2019ll see. We always respect the democratic will of the people. It should be like that if they vote for someone and they vote for a party, they have a good reason for it.One of the prominent politicians involved in the Patriotic Spring has been Austrian FP\u00d6 candidate for president Norbert Hofer. \u00a0Hofer recently visited\u00a0the Czech president in Prague and both expressed a desire for Austria to join the Visegrad 4 group who have shown solidarity against the mass migration policies of Western leaders like Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel.On Austrian membership into the group, Kov\u00e1cs\u00a0said:Austria has always rather belonged to Central Europe, not the Western part of Europe. With the facts and the consequences of what is happening on the southern and eastern borders of Europe now with migration, it would be an interesting turn and development if the Austrians realised that.We see it in that political campaign in Austria with the presidential elections, but we also see it in the Foreign Minister who has been very outspoken on migration issues and [is] fair and understanding about the perspectives of the Central European countries that Hungary represents for obvious reasons.They have the legacy, they have the political knowledge of why you should listen to Central Europe.The Hungarian government Mr.\u00a0Kov\u00e1cs represents has been one of the most forthright in Europe during the migrant crisis, offering its people a referendum on whether they wanted European Union-forced mass migration \u2014 98 per cent did not \u2014 and\u00a0proving building walls can reduce illegal migration. After Hungary\u2019s southern border fence was completed in 2015 illegal incursions into the nation dropped from tens of thousands daily to just a few dozen overnight.Breitbart London, Immigration, Europe Migrant Crisis, hungary, Patriot spring, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1csComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Euroscepticism is caused by different EU policies and there is no magic bullet to cure it.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French National Front, is on the march. She is an elected MEP who led her party to victory in the 2014 European Parliament elections with almost 25% of the vote. Even more worryingly forthe European Union, it\u2019s likely she will gain enough votes to be included in the French Presidential run-off. It is possible she could be the French President next year.Le Pen\u2019s flagship policy is a French in-out referendum in which she will campaign to \u2018Leave\u2019 the EU. The overwhelming concern in France is immigration, caused by the EU\u2019s borderless Schengen Area and freedom of movement \u2013 and the opinion polls are telling.Over 60% of French people view the EU negatively and \u2018Leave\u2019 trails \u2018Remain\u2019 by only around 12%.In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders from the populist-right Freedom Party is calling for an EU referendum. His party is currently ahead in the opinion polls on 22%, but is likely to be kept out of any future coalition by mainstream parties who refuse to work with him.As with France, in the Netherlands immigration is the contentious EU issue. They have a history of Euroscepticism too, famously voting against the EU\u2019s Constitutional Treaty and recently against the EU\u2019s deal with Ukraine.It is also important to remember, the Netherlands has close trading links with the UK, favouring a free trade approach. If the EU attempts to roll back on any free trade approach once the UK leaves the bloc and erects barriers against UK trade, they will make so-called \u2018Nexit\u2019 far more likely.One of the EU\u2019s most disastrous policies has been the Euro currency. We are therefore obliged to mention Greece. In 2016 over 61% of Greek voters rejected the bailout package they were offered, but it was forced on them anyway.Membership of the Euro allowed Greece to borrow money too cheaply creating a bubble fuelled by mass debt, without a central bank to facilitate a competitive devolution. The Greek economy collapsed, condemning future generations to poverty. Greece is only a charismatic Eurosceptic leader away from an EU exit.Germany is often considered one of the most pro-EU countries, however Euroscepticism is even on the rise here. Next year Germany\u2019s Eurosceptic AfD Party are almost certain to have seats in the German Parliament after defeating Merkel\u2019s party in recent regional elections.The continual Greek bailouts and the weakness of the Schengen Area are causing tension. However, a vote to leave could only occur if Germany\u2019s contributions to the EU and its currency become unsustainable, combined with its influence being steadily diminished.Denmark is another country with a growing Eurosceptic party. The right-wing Danish People\u2019s Party, and even left-wing parties are calling for a referendum. EU support is still strong and increasing in the wake of Brexit. However, 40% want a referendum, and if Britain makes a success of it then Danish opinion may change.Finish Eurosceptics forced a debate in Parliament about leaving the Euro currency after receiving over 50,000 signatures. The Eurosceptic Finns Party is a member of the coalition government after coming second in the 2015 election.Whereas the Finns Party is Eurosceptic, it does not advocate EU withdrawal. Instead, it argues for renegotiation and a referendum. Their view in an EU referendum is likely to depend on how Britain fares and the amount of immigration reform on offer, as this is their number one issue.The Swedish Democrats are calling for Sweden to exit the EU and the Left Party are also calling for a referendum. They have 49 seats in the Swedish Parliament and echo the concerns of the Swedish people over immigration. Fortunately, Sweden did not adopt the Euro after rejecting it in a referendum.Sweden has strong trading links with the UK and any future Swedish referendum is likely to depend on whether the UK makes Brexit work.A Spanish exit is highly unlikely, but a Catalonia one is not. Independence for Catalonia is a very popular view, with separatists in charge of the regional government. They are wealthy enough to go it alone and had a referendum in 2014 where over 80% voted for independence, a result which is not recognised by Spain. If the Catalans declare independence from Spain, they would be forced under EU rules to leave the EU too.Hungary has deep anti-immigration sentiment, with nearly 98% of those taking part in its recent referendum voting against the EU\u2019s migrant quotas. The referendum was not valid due to turnout, but this has sent a strong message to Brussels. This, however, is more of an attempt to increase influence within the EU, rather than signalling a willingness to leave.The Eurozone\u2019s problems and immigration dominate the Italian news agenda. The Five Star Movement want to leave the Euro and reject the EU\u2019s increasing influence in Italy\u2019s affairs. They are currently leading the opinion polls and will be a major player in any future Italian election. 44% of Italians want an EU referendum. Further Eurozone problems could also pave the way for their exit.Euroscepticism is here to stay. The EU must change or collapse. We at Get Britain Out are positive the EU is incapable of change, and therefore collapse is inevitable.Matthew Ellery is a Research Executive at Get Britain OutBreitbart London, Immigration, Brexit, EU referendum, Frange, Germany, Greece, hungary, Netherlands, SwedenComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The one that I heard was a song about white power and this kept going on and on. It was very loud and distinctive.\u201dA permit for the event was required from East Cambridgeshire District Council, and an application was lodged for a \u201cprivate party with music.\u201d During the application process Cambridgeshire Constabulary was consulted as to whether they had any objections. They said they had none as the organiser claimed the event was being held in support of Help for Heroes.Yet Cambridgeshire police spokesman has now told Cambridge News: \u201cThere was a three day music event held the weekend before last in a private field near Haddenham with the owner\u2019s permission. We had been in contact with other forces about similar events and were aware of a possible right wing element.\u201cSenior officers planned and implemented a response proportionate to the risk.\u201cWe worked with organisers and landowner and the event took place without any disorder or crime committed.\u201dHelp for Heroes, which works on behalf of injured soldiers and their families, denied any connection to the event, adding that they would not accept donations from extremist groups.The Campaign Against Antisemitism has questioned why the Police force allowed the event to go ahead if they believed it had a connection to extremism, and why no charges are being brought against the group despite video evidence of clear anti-Semitism emerging from the rally.A spokesman for the Campaign said: \u201cCambridgeshire Constabulary say they knew that this event was organised by the far-right but they also say they thought it was a charity event for Help for Heroes. They say they knew that Nazi salutes and anti-Semitic singing took place, but that no crime was committed.\u201cIt is staggering that in 2016 in Britain a police force is allowing neo-Nazi from a group banned across Europe to enter our country, use it as a haven for fascism, rally against Jews and then claim that no part of that was unlawful. We are lodging a formal complaint\u00a0and expect the conduct of the police officers concerned to be investigated, and the neo-Nazi perpetrators identifiable from the video footage to be prosecuted for their crimes.\u201dThe footage suggests the group may have broken laws including\u00a0section 29B\u00a0of the Public Order Act 1986 which states: \u201cA person who uses threatening words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening, is guilty of an offence if he intends thereby to stir up religious hatred.\u201dThe maximum penalty, after a trial in the Crown Court, is seven years\u2019 imprisonment. Incitement to racial hatred and acts likely to stir up racial hatred are also illegal.Cambridgeshire Police came under severe criticism in August of this year when a number of its officers threatened the leader of PEGIDA UK, Tommy Robinson, with criminal charges unless he removed himself and his three young children, all under the age of ten, from the city of Cambridge immediately.The family was at a pub with friends following attendance at a football match when the incident happened. Robinson reported that his children were all visibly upset by the presence of the officers, who followed them over a mile and a half to the train station.Watch: Video reportedly captured at the eventBreitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart London, anti-semitism, British police, Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Campaign Against Antisemitism, Neo-Nazis, Tommy RobinsonComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Accusing Taseer of being an apostate, the booklet adds that being a \u201cbig shot\u201d does not excuse someone from the punishment of death, the Evening Standard has reported.A worshipper at the mosque who was handed the booklet has told the paper: \u201cThe event was a few months ago. I took one, but other people took them as well.\u201cI think more than 100 people were at this event. It was at Giyarween Shareef [a holy gathering].\u201cTwo or three people delivered the leaflet. Unfortunately, I am shocked. I think it gives a bad impression. Islam teaches when you live here you obey the law and the rule of law, but this is not doing that.\u201dThe booklet carries the name of the mosque\u2019s Imam, Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani, on its front cover along with a picture of him. According to the National Registry, Jilani co-owns the mosque with three others.The mosque is also home to the International Muslim Movement charity, for which Mr. Jilani is a trustee.In 2013, Jilani was at the centre of a controversy when Islamic station DM Digital was fined \u00a385,000\u00a0by Ofcom for broadcasting a sermon of his in which he reportedly said Muslims had a duty to kill those who insult Mohammed.However, he has denied having anything to do with the material, telling the Evening\u00a0Standard: \u201cI do not agree with the booklet\u2019s contents. I am not aware of if, why or how, the booklet was distributed in Dar-ul-Uloom Qadria Jilania.\u201cIf it was distributed\u2026 then this was done without any authorisation by either me or any member of the\u00a0committee of Dar-ul-Uloom Qadria Jilania.\u201dRegarding the Ofcom fine, he insisted that his broadcast remarks made in response to a question on Islamic law in Pakistan, saying: \u201cOfcom made a decision against DM Digital TV, not me. Ofcom has failed to understand the speech in the context in which the referenced comment was made.\u201dA Scotland Yard spokesman said: \u201cWe will be assessing the contents of these leaflets to establish whether any criminal offence has taken place.\u201cWe are committed to tackling hate crime in all its forms and have long since recognised the impact of hate crime on communities.\u201dThe Charity Commission said: \u201cWe are assessing the information received as a matter of urgency so as to establish the facts and have contacted the charity\u2019s trustees for their response.\u201cAt this time, the commission has not opened a statutory inquiry into the charity.

He reports that the episode is just the latest in a pattern of so-called humanitarian groups spreading false information to mobilise migrants.These organisations, Foldi argues, serve a dual purpose of promoting open borders activism as model behaviour. Depicted by the media as\u00a0humanitarians, and their actions pushed as being morally \u201ccorrect\u201d, he says this \u201chas an effect on the average citizen, who is taken in by it\u201d.The intelligence expert points out that spreading disinformation so as to rally crowds of migrants towards European borders is not actually a humanitarian thing to do, and more resembles a direct attack on state policy.He asks: \u201cBecause would it not be more humane for the people who arrived in Belgrade \u2014 illegally, I might add, without any travel documents and visas \u2014 to suggest that they visit the Hungarian consulate there and ask for a visa.\u201dQuestioning why a so-called humanitarian organisation would want to move migrant masses to the Hungarian border, Mr. Foldi says they are acting as part of a \u201cwell-established system, built years ago\u201d.\u201cWhat we seeing every day here is a fourth generation military operation against Europe. Not using traditional weaponry to enforce a strategy, but using economic and social infrastructure, and one element of that is the actions carried out by civilian humanitarian organisations,\u201d he explains.Mr. Foldi says Brussels directs \u201cformal political attacks\u201d on his nation\u2019s migrant policies because they \u201cwant to kill off at the roots any rebellious attitude, which is represented by Hungary, against a strategy they planned well ahead\u201d.Stating that Brussels\u2019s goal \u201cis to convert Europe into a multicultural system, a system which is above nations\u201d, Mr. Foldi argues that the EU is forcefully attacking Hungary because the country has taken concrete action to protect itself from being forced into multiculturalism.He concludes: \u201cThis is well-coordinated; it is not separate that Brussels wants something, the MSM wants something, and the civilian organisations want something, too. But this is a very well-coordinated effort, where it is only that tasks are divided between the branches of the same attack force.\u201dHungary\u2019s Prime Minister Victor Orb\u00e1n last year slammed the role of so-called humanitarian bodies in mass migration to Europe.He stated: \u201cThis invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other by those [human rights] activists who support everything that weakens the nation-state. This Western mindset and this activist network are perhaps best represented by George Soros.\u201dHungarian billionaire George Soros has admitted involvement in the crisis which saw over a million migrants enter the continent last year.Breitbart London, Immigration, Europe Migrant Crisis, George Soros, hungary, serbian border, Victor OrbanComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But we find it hard to recognise this reality and to respond by defending the Christian faith.\u201d\u201cMany people do not understand what Islam really is,\u201d he added. \u201cThey create these slogans: we all believe in the same God, we are all united by love and so on. It\u2019s not true.\u201dHe also said that modern Christians are often unwilling to proclaim their beliefs, and should not be afraid to convert people of other faiths.\u201cChristians have neglected a fundamental truth: there is only one Saviour of the world: Jesus Christ. We must not proselytize, imposing Christianity, but if we believe in Jesus it is our duty to bear witness.\u201cI think that this witness is not very strong, even in countries that were called Christian once upon a time, such as the European nations.\u201dCardinal Burke, who is regarded as a leading traditionalist within the Catholic Church, went on to say that Islam poses a threat to the Western order because it makes no distinction between religion and the state.\u201cIslam is a threat in the sense that for the true Muslim, Allah must rule the world. Christ said in the Gospel: \u2018Render unto Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s\u2019. By contrast, the Islamic religion which is based on the law of the Koran aims to govern all countries where there are Muslims.\u201cWhile they are the minority they cannot insist, but when they become the majority they must apply the Sharia.\u201dWe can already see this in some Muslim-majority neighbourhoods, the cardinal added.\u201cToday there are enclaves, entire neighbourhoods, in Europe where there is in fact Muslim rule.\u201dSpeaking about so-called \u201cno-go zones\u201d such as Molenbeek, Cardinal Burke said that the existence of such neighbourhoods represented a failure of integration, calling them \u201ca state within a state\u201d.\u201cThe problem is that Muslims aim for expansion,\u201d he added. \u201cThe whole history of the Islamic presence in Europe is an attempt to conquer it.\u201dRather than through arms, that expansion will come through immigration and high birth rate.\u201cSeveral times I have heard Islamists explaining: \u2018What we failed to do with weapons in the past, we are doing today with birth rate and immigration.\u2019 The population is changing. If this keeps up, in countries like Italy, the majority will be Muslim.\u201dHowever, the blame for all this lies squarely on the decline of Western society.\u201cAll this happens through the corruption of the West. There are not enough families. We supinely accept practices that are contrary to the natural law, such as abortion or so-called \u201cmarriage\u201d between persons of the same sex. It is proof that we are not strong enough in faith, and easy prey for conquest.\u201dBreitbart London, Faith, Cardinal Raymond Burke, Catholic ChurchComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Three Druze and 13 Yazidis were also resettled.This is despite Syria\u2019s Christian population before the war accounting for about ten per cent of the country\u2019s population \u2013 and widespread acknowledgement that the Christian population in Syria is suffering extreme persecution.Charity Open Doors, which works on behalf of persecuted Christians worldwide,\u00a0reports: \u201cIslamic State (IS) attacked 35 Christian villages in February 2015 alone, abducting over 250 people and driving 3,000 others from their homes; the militants later executed three Christian hostages. It is impossible to be a Christian in IS-controlled areas, and even in areas still controlled by the government, evangelism and conversion from Islam are illegal.\u201dIn April, the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry even went so far as to declare Islamic State as \u201cresponsible for genocide\u201d against Christians, Yazidis and other minority groups in the territories it controls.Despite the outflow of people from the region, there are still believed to be around 772,000 Christians remaining in the country, making up more than four per cent of the current population.Yet the UN Agency charged with overseeing aid operations in the region, the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has been accused of marginalising Christians and other minorities, both within refugee camps in the region, and through its resettlement programmes.According to Nina Shea, an international human rights lawyer with more than thirty years\u2019 experience behind her, the fault in the UNHCR lies at the very top.Writing for the Wall Street Journal, she recounted an exchange she had in December with the UN\u2019s then-high commissioner for refugees,\u00a0Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in which she inquired why so few Christians were being resettled abroad.\u201cThe replies \u2013 from a man poised to be the U.N\u2019s next secretary-general \u2013 were shocking and illuminating,\u201d she wrote.\u201cMr. Guterres said that generally Syria\u2019s Christians should not be resettled, because they are part of the \u201cDNA of the Middle East\u201d. He added that Lebanon\u2019s Christian president had asked him not to remove Christian refugees. Mr. Guterres thus appeared to be articulating what amounts to a religious-discrimination policy, for political ends.\u201dIn January, a report by the Catholic News\u00a0Service\u00a0on Christian refugees in Lebanon, where the majority of Syrian refugees are encamped, stated: \u201cExit options seem hopeless as refugees complain that the staff members of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are not following up on their cases after an initial interview.\u201dThe outcome for Christians in the region is disastrous.Fearing persecution from Muslims within the refugee camps, and unsure of being resettled, many Christians are opting to stay away. Instead, they are seeking shelter in the homes of fellow Christians, even if it means sleeping 30 to a room, according to John Pontifex, head of information at\u00a0Aid to the Church in Need.He told Christian Today that the Home Office figures highlight \u201cthe degree to which Christians are being left out. They are unable to claim proper help or to seek asylum in the West.\u201cThis is a community of suffering that has just disappeared below the radar. It is a crying shame, and these figures point to the way the crisis facing Christians, Yazidis and other minority faiths has been completely overlooked.\u201dA Home Office spokesperson commented: \u201cThe UK has been at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. We have committed to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees through our Vulnerable Persons Resettlement scheme over the course of this parliament \u2014 we are on track to achieve that and have already provided refuge to more than 2,800 under this route.\u201cWe are clear that the scheme will prioritise the most vulnerable refugees, which is why under the VPR scheme the UNHCR identifies refugees for resettlement using its established vulnerability criteria.\u201dBreitbart London, Faith, Antonio Guterres, Christian Refugees, Islamic State, Syria, UNHCR, YazidisComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

States could refuse to take people for a year \u2014 but only if they paid another country 250,000 euros per person to accommodate them.Slovakia and Hungary have also challenged at the European Court of Justice an earlier decision on a one-off relocation of 160,000 asylum seekers agreed last year, as Greece struggled to cope with the chaotic arrival of nearly a million people.Breitbart London, Europe Migrant Crisis, migrant quota, SlovakiaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Therefore in terms of that element of foreign policy: Trump.\u201dMr. Kov\u00e1cs was quick to note that he and his government in Hungary would not officially endorse either candidate as that it was neither their custom nor their policy to interfere in the elections of sovereign nations.\u201cBut no endorsement, it\u2019s too early and we\u2019ve never done anything like that,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cBefore an election, it would be most impolite to do anything like that as one of them will become one of our\u00a0most important allies and strategic partners around the globe.\u201dHowever, Kov\u00e1cs did intimate that he was not as keen on the past few years of the Obama administration\u2019s dealing with Hungary and the Central European region.\u201cMy first-hand experience, the experience of the government, [is that] the U.S. has lost interest, and probably with it, knowledge about the region.\u00a0Europe in general, but most certainly about Central Europe.\u201d\u201cKnowledge and understanding is really needed to re-engage and reinforce this partnership. I\u2019m being polite and diplomatic for obvious reasons here because again; from the Hungarian perspective, America was there, was helping us and is a major ally,\u201d he said.The Hungarian government spokesman alluded to the attitudes of both the Obama administration and Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton on their heavily anti-Russia stances.

In 2012 you had a Labour party MP punching a Conservative party MP and a Labour Party MP in the House of Commons.\u201dCalling the incident in Strasbourg yesterday a \u201ccontemporary example of what UKIP\u2019s problems are\u201d, Kassam conceded that questions surrounding the party\u2019s identity after the Brexit vote has raised tensions.\u201cThere is an existential crisis in the party. It currently doesn\u2019t know where it goes from here in a post-referendum world. The MEPs in Brussels and Strasbourg don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to be doing for income in two years. There is no party leader. And so tensions are very much high at the moment inside the party and I\u2019m afraid it looks like it\u2019s spilled over into what I would describe as a very human event, a very regrettable event.\u201dKassam stated that having both exchanged text messages with Woolfe and spoken to former UKIP leader Nigel Farage on the telephone just before going on air, the events of yesterday are still uncertain.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a clear idea of what happened yet, whether it was punching or pushing. Steven is understood to have fallen into a bar or a glass railing,\u201d he disclosed.Noting that Farage has announced an investigation into the episode, Kassam said the party can learn and move forward when the facts are ascertained, and urged people to avoid speculating or attributing blame in the meantime.He said: \u201cLet\u2019s just wait till the facts come out, let\u2019s ascertain some facts, let\u2019s have an investigation, and then we can see how we can move positively forward as a party and avoid things like this in the future.\u201dThis week the Breitbart London editor in chief threw his own hat into the ring for the UKIP leadership. Kassam says that he is the best-placed candidate to carry on the legacy of Farage, who grew the party from being a little-known fringe group to winning the European Parliamentary elections in the UK in 2014.To continue Farage\u2019s good work, which culminated in four million votes for the party in the 2014 General Election, Kassam outlines his vision for the party as \u00a0\u201cgiving a voice to British people who had been left behind by the country\u2019s embrace of globalism in recent decades.\u201dBreitbart London, Breitbart TV, UKIP, CNN, Nigel Farage, raheem kassam, Steven Woolfe, UKIP leadership contestComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The Socialist politician also said he hoped a further 20,000 spouses of French citizens would be naturalised each year through marriage.Causeur reports that it is very much an \u201copen secret\u201d that in recent months the department which manages accession to French nationality has been \u201ca machine that is naturalising in full swing\u201d.Reportedly, naturalisations have risen at a rate far higher than in recent years. Between 2013 and 2015 the rate at which the decree was given increased by 17 per cent, whilst it had halved between 2010 and 2012 before Valls took office and modified the rules.In 2015 the department had more than met the Prime Minister\u2019s goal of 100,000, naturalising 113,603 people. Causeur discovered that the number of \u201cnew French\u201d this year could exceed last year\u2019s total by 45 per cent.The majority of people who are being granted citizenship are not European, accounting for 78 per cent of the total. Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians top the list of \u201cnew French\u201d, followed by Turks and Senegalese people.Causeur notes that applications for citizenship are received by the sub-directorate of access to French nationality of the Interior Ministry, where they are approved or refused, and then sent on to the central record keeping service which realises the process.The journal found that this service \u201chas a stock of 10,000 pending cases which have already been accepted by the Interior Ministry\u201d, something which Causeur states is \u201cextremely rare\u201d.With the presidential election set for next year, polls have for months shown president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande losing to all likely adversaries. According to a 2012 survey of 10,000 voters, 93 per cent of Muslims in France voted for the Socialist Party president, who is the most unpopular head of France in modern history.In his successful presidential campaign, Hollande promised an amnesty to all of the estimated 400,000 Muslims illegally in France.Now a huge, and growing, electoral bloc, commentators have observed that Muslims in France decided the election. An \u00a0estimated 1.7 million of them voted for Hollande in 2012, who beat incumbent president Nicolas Sarkozy by just 1.1 million votes.Breitbart London, Faith, Immigration, France, France presidential election, Islam, Islam in France, manuel valls, Socialist Party FranceComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

You remember the Labour\u00a0Party MP Eric Joyce, in 2012, had\u00a0this \u2013 you\u2019ve had members of the Conservative Party engaging in fisticuffs\u00a0in Parliament as well.\u201cThese things\u00a0can happen, it\u2019s a very human thing to happen when you don\u2019t have a leader, when\u00a0you don\u2019t necessarily have a raison d\u2019\u00eatre, when things\u00a0are a little bit in existential crisis, then\u00a0passions can overflow.\u201d\u201cI think both of these two men, again to echo\u00a0what Michael [Hookem, the other party in the altercation] said we don\u2019t know\u00a0truly what happened, but I think both of these two men will look back on this and think\u00a0\u2018that did not reflect well on me or\u00a0my party\u2019.\u201dIn-fighting broke out again following the incident after Neil Hamilton, the leader of UKIP\u00a0in the Welsh Assembly, told BBC News that Mr. Woolfe had \u201cpicked a fight [\u2026] and came off worse.\u201dIn response, major party donor Arron Banks issued a statement threatening to leave the party \u201cIf Neil Hamilton and [UKIP MP] Douglas Carswell remain in the party, and the NEC [National Executive Committee] decide that Steven Woolfe can not run for leader.\u201dMr. Banks called for new elections to the NEC as well as for leader, adding: \u201cit is clear that we ourselves, are at breaking point.\u201dKassam told Snow that he could \u201csympathise\u201d with Banks\u2019 position, saying: \u201cwhen Neil Hamilton uses this incident \u2013 while Steven Woolfe is laying in a hospital \u2013 to attack the party leader, to attack different figures in the party, this is the exact problem we\u2019re talking about.\u201dBut he added that he did not sympathise with the tone Banks had employed in his statement, calling for more reconciliatory action all round.\u201cIf\u00a0today has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we\u00a0need to take a step back, we need to reflect very\u00a0seriously not just on this incident and what it means, but we need to reflect on who we are as a political party, what\u00a0we are as a movement, what we stand for, what we\u2019re going to do going forward, and start positively campaigning on those issues remembering we\u2019re all on the same side,\u201d he said.He added firmly: \u201cThis is an open call to all UKippers out there: either get together or get lost.\u201dOn Sunday it emerged, via a new book, that Douglas Carswell had defected from the Conservatives in 2014 not because he shared UKIP\u2019s aims, but to infiltrate the party to \u201cneutralise\u201d leader Nigel Farage. The revelation confirmed suspicions that many, including Kassam, had had about his motives.Last night Kassam was unequivocal in setting out his solution for the party infighting, saying: \u201cIf you do want to solve this problem then you have to say to the people who aren\u2019t Ukippers through and through, who have done things that are completely contrary to what the party has stood for for so long, you have to say to them: \u2018Thank you for being in this party, but I\u2019m afraid your services are no longer required.\u2019\u201dQuestions as to whether UKIP still has a purpose now that the Conservative Party is actively working towards taking Britain out of the European Union, Kassam said it does, namely: to represent working class interests.\u201c[L]ook at the party\u2019s manifesto from 2015, how much it has influenced the government on issues like grammar schools,\u201d he said.\u201cUKIP may well have been a single issue party once upon a time, it is not a single issue party any more, and it actually represents people way across the country who feel that they can\u2019t vote for the Conservative Party and they can\u2019t vote for the Labour Party because they\u2019ve been left behind by Conservative and Labour governments. UKIP does have a serious raison d\u2019\u00eatre, we need to find it and project it\u201d.Breitbart London, Breitbart TV, UKIP, douglas carswell, raheem kassam, Steven Woolfe, ukipComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Williams, Ph.D.7 Oct 20160On Thursday, a Spanish Civil Guard ship carrying 1258 migrants rescued off the coast of Libya landed at Cagliari, on the Italian island of Sardinia. After a two-day sea journey, the vessel Rio Segura was told that all the migrant shelters are full and therefore the migrants would have to remain aboard the ship until provisions could be made for their housing.A new procedure of migrant identification and registration has been instituted according to which photo identification would take place before migrants will be permitted to descend from rescue vessels. The situation in Sardinia is so serious that the Cagliari Civil Defense has been using the terminal intended for cruise ships as the identification center for the first reception of migrants.\u201cThe operation could go on for three or four days,\u201d said the commissioner Danilo Gagliardi. \u201cThe structure will remain in operation until we can identify all as required under the new ministerial directive.\u201dOfficials say that all the welcome centers and refugee shelters in Sardinia\u2019s four provinces are completely full and can accept no more migrants until some of the present occupants are relocated.\u201cThe situation is deteriorating,\u201d says Omar Zahed, spokesman for the Islamic community of Sardinia. \u201cThe reception is improvised. It is not possible that when refugees arrive here there is still no plan what to do with them. Unfortunately, we cannot stop the flow, it is time that we organize for the long term.\u201dItaly has been particularly hard hit this week by the arrival of thousands of migrants. Between Monday and Tuesday, a record number of over ten thousand mostly African migrants were rescued in the Strait of Sicily and brought to Italy, bringing the year\u2019s total to over 142,000.The Italian Coast Guard coordinated dozens of\u00a0rescue\u00a0missions off the coast of Libya in the two days, recovered over 6,000 migrants on Monday in one of the largest single-day operations of the European migration crisis, and then another 4,655 on Tuesday.Federico Soda, Director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Office in Rome, said that among the migrants arriving in Italy there has been a noted increase in West African nationalities. \u201cOften these are people who leave their country of origin without a specific destination. Libya is where many are smuggled to and the majority of migrants there face extreme violence and abuse. Some, scared for their lives, decide to continue their journey to Europe,\u201d he said.According to the IOM, the Channel of Sicily is currently the deadliest border in the world: 3,610 people died while crossing the Mediterranean in 2016 and out of these, 3,134 died trying to reach Italy.Follow Thomas D.

He claims that officers in Germany are putting themselves at constant risk as many of the migrants are known to have a high level of violent\u00a0behaviour\u00a0and attack police who attempt to arrest them.\u201cIf there is no pre-trial detention made, no imprisonment is imposed, and no deportations carried out then the police make multiple arrests and the perpetrators get away with it,\u201d he said and\u00a0maintained\u00a0that the migrants end up back on the streets.Mr. Wendt cited the \u201cCasablanca Report\u201d which documented some 2,244 North African migrant criminals in the city of Dusseldorf.\u00a0According\u00a0to the police union chief, the numbers for other major German cities are similar and he said that the migrant crisis has only served to reinforce numbers in the already-existing migrant criminal gangs.Last year, Mr. Wendt made a similar statement at the height of the migrant crisis. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect our law,\u201d he said and asked\u00a0why \u201cthings always have to go up in flames\u201d before politicians \u201creact\u201d.Development Minister Gerd M\u00fcller of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said that the\u00a0government\u00a0of Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel forecasts a massive increase in migrants from Africa.\u201cThe migration pressure will increase dramatically in the coming years if we do not manage to create economic opportunities in African countries,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwhat happens there has a direct impact on Europe\u201d.The findings match a report from the European Union border agency Frontex who earlier this year reported that the future of the migrant crisis was young migrant men coming from Africa to Europe for better economic opportunities rather than legitimate refugees fleeing conflict\u00a0or persecution.Breitbart London, Immigration, Europe Migrant Crisis, Germany asylum seekers, Migrant Crime, Rainer WendtComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The protest had come at a time of heightened tensions between the people of Calais and migrants living in the nearby Jungle camp, which had led to a ban on demonstrations in the town.Official portrait of General Christian Piquemal as commander of the French Foreign Legion / http://en.legion-etrangere.com/Ignoring the prohibition, the General addressed the crowd leading to his arrest \u2013 an event which led to uproar in France as the Foreign Legion is highly regarded among French patriots.However, a later court hearing cleared the General of involvement in the organisation of the meeting, and the General thought that was the end of the matter.Yet in September he received a letter from the military informing him that he was no longer to consider himself an active part of the military, it has now emerged.It appears that at a\u00a0meeting of the High Council of the Army held in June, Army officials advised the Ministry of Defence to strip him of his office without informing the General or his lawyers of the proceedings being held against him. The President, Prime Minister, and Defence Ministers, however, were informed.\u201cI\u2019m deeply shocked by this unfair and unjustified decision, which seems to me to be excessive and disproportionate,\u201d the General told Le Figaro.The sanctions are \u201ctotally detached from the reality of my acquittal, offending every measure of decency,\u201d the General said.Although the General\u2019s rank cannot be withdrawn, he has been banned from wearing his uniform or using his Military ID, which in principle are granted for life. In addition, he has lost his reserve list status.It is these sanctions, which represent a return to civilian life, which \u201churt the most\u201d, the General said, rather than the financial penalties which will result from the sanction.\u201cI find it unacceptable that I can be ostracised in this way after giving forty years in the service of France. To be ditched like that and treated as an outcast.\u201dThe General added that he now intends to take his case to the State Council, going all the way to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.In the meantime a group of supporters has rallied around the General, forming a defence force composed of military personnel and civilians, and chaired by General (2nd Division) Anthony Martinez.For many of them, this disciplinary action is nothing more than \u201ca political settling of accounts\u201d, one military member of the group said.The General concluded: \u201cIf the administration believes that I have transgressed my reserve duty [which continues to be valid for retired soldiers], by using my freedom of expression, this can only mean one thing: that my freedom of expression cannot be in line with that of the majority of the population. If it does not comply with political correctness, then it is sanctioned.\u201cThe truth is that my case is an instrument to silence the Grande Muette [a French expression meaning the silent voice of the military]\u00a0because other generals have expressed more controversial expressions before.\u00a0They want to make me an example to silence the ranks.\u201dBreitbart London, Immigration, Calais, Europe Migrant Crisis, France, Islam in France, military, PEGIDAComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

They said they decided to go ahead with the campaign even though the director is a \u201c1948 Palestinian,\u201d a term used to describe Israel\u2019s Palestinian community, because it is featured as an Israeli production.They referred to her quote on the Israeli news site Ynet, where she said: \u201cI\u2019m Palestinian and my movie is Israeli. It\u2019s been funded by Israeli film funds and I see no problem with it.\u201dThe campaign also disapproved of \u201cthe attempts to embellish the situation and to avoid hurting the feelings of Arabs in Israel by labeling it an Israeli-Palestinian production, but by doing that they made things worse. We don\u2019t recognize anything called Israel-Palestine, and neither do millions of Arabs. According to the overwhelming majority of Arabs, including the Lebanese people and the Lebanese state, it\u2019s an illegal entity that occupies 78 percent of historical Palestine. Adding the word \u201cPalestine\u201d to Israel does not absolve the organizers of legitimizing the appropriation of 78 percent of Israel.\u201dThey said that boycotting the film does not mean that \u201cwe have forgotten our people in occupied Palestine of 1948 [Israeli Arabs] who constitute, for us, a bulwark in our fight against Zionism. On the contrary, we strive to cooperate with our brethren there provided they do not label themselves as Israelis and refrain from cooperating with producers, directors, funders and actors.

But \u201che said he\u2019s not perfect, he apologized.\u201dHe added that there is \u201cno chance\u201d Trump will quit.According to Zell, Trump\u2019s decade-old comments pale in comparison to Hillary Clinton\u2019s offenses, not least of which are\u00a0the leaked emails \u2013 also released over the weekend \u2013 showing her questionable relationship with Wall Street.\u201cThe public wants Trump, with all of his shortcomings, over Clinton with her failures, her corruption, her lies,\u201d he said.\u201cI have five daughters and they will all, all, vote for Trump,\u201d Zell added.As several GOP leaders announced the withdrawal of support for Trump following the audio\u2019s release, Zell called on Republicans to band together.\u201cI call upon all the Republican leadership, who understand like we do that we need a change to the White House immediately and undo eight years of damage caused by Obama and Clinton to the United States around the world \u2014 to unite and to support the ticket, from the top to the bottom,\u201d Zell said.Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign manager in Israel Tzvika Brot told Army Radio that it \u201cwas good he regretted [his comments], but he isn\u2019t running for chief rabbi.

It removed the demand for an end to air strikes on\u00a0Aleppo and put the focus back on a failed Sept. 9 U.S./Russia ceasefire deal, which was annexed to the draft.British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin: \u201cThanks to your actions today, Syrians will continue to lose their lives in Aleppo and beyond to Russian and Syrian bombing. Please stop now.\u201dSyrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces, backed by Russian war planes and Iranian support, have been battling to capture eastern Aleppo, the rebel-held half of Syria\u2019s largest city, where more than 250,000 civilians are trapped.\u201cRussia has become one of the chief purveyors of terror in Aleppo, using tactics more commonly associated with thugs than governments,\u201d U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations David Pressman told the council.He said Russia was \u201cintent on allowing the killing to continue and, indeed, participating in carrying it out\u201d and that what was needed from Moscow was \u201cless talk and more action from them to stop the slaughter.\u201dA U.N. resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes to be adopted. The veto powers are the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China. The Russian text only received four votes in favor, so a veto was not needed to block it.The French draft received 11 votes in favor, while China and Angola abstained. Venezuela joined Russia in voting against it.It was the fifth time Russia has used its veto on a U.N. resolution on Syria during the more than five-year conflict.The previous four times China backed Moscow in protecting Syria\u2019s government from council action, including vetoing a bid to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. China voted in favor of Russia\u2019s draft on Saturday.\u2018STRANGE SPECTACLE\u2019China\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said some of the content of the French draft \u201cdoes not reflect the full respect for the sovereignty, independence, unification and territorial integrity of Syria,\u201d while the content of the Russian draft did.\u201cWe regret that the (Russian draft) resolution was not adopted,\u201d he told the council.Russia only gained the support of China, Venezuela and Egypt for its draft resolution. Angola and Uruguay abstained, while the remaining nine council members voted against.Churkin, who is council president for October, described the dual votes on Saturday as one of the \u201cstrangest spectacles in the history of the Security Council.\u201d\u201cGiven that the crisis in Syria is at a critical stage, when it is particularly important that there be a coordination of the political efforts of the international community, this waste of time is inadmissible,\u201d Churkin told the council.Syrian government forces recaptured territory from insurgents in several western areas on Saturday.Both the French and Russian U.N. draft resolutions called for a truce and humanitarian aid access throughout Syria.\u201cIf we don\u2019t so something this town (Aleppo) will soon just be in ruins and will remain in history as a town in which the inhabitants were abandoned to their executioners,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said. \u201cIf the international community does not wake up it will share the responsibility.\u201dThe council negotiated for a week on the text drafted by France. Russia circulated its own draft on Friday and said it would be put to a vote after the French text on Saturday.Angola\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins said his country abstained on both votes because it did not want to be drawn into the acrimony between the United States and Russia.The United States on Monday suspended talks with Russia on implementing a ceasefire deal in Syria, accusing Moscow of not living up to its commitments to halt fighting and ensure aid reached besieged communities.A crackdown by Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 sparked a civil war and Islamic State militants have used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq.

There was insufficient time to decide whether to grant or reject these requests before the next scheduled hearing next Monday.The spokesman added bluntly that he couldn\u2019t understand why prosecutors would employ a legal tactic that left them open to charges they had \u201ctorpedoed the proceedings which they themselves had launched.\u201dThe charges against Zafke focus on a one-month period in 1944 when 14 trains carrying prisoners \u2014 including the teenage diarist Anne Frank \u2014 arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau.Frank, who arrived in Auschwitz with her parents and sister, was later transferred to another camp, Bergen-Belsen, where she died in March 1945, just two months before the Nazis were defeated.Thursday\u2019s announcement marked the end of a case that had been marred by five delays and at times deteriorated into farce, increasingly frustrating victims\u2019 lawyers.The International Auschwitz Committee, which represents Holocaust survivors, had sharply attacked Germany\u2019s handling of the case, saying the court was hurtling \u201cbetween sloppy ignorance and complete disinterest\u201d in a resolution.Some 1.1 million people, most of them European Jews, perished between 1940 and 1945 in Auschwitz before it was liberated by Soviet forces.More than 70 years after the prosecution of top Nazis began in Nuremberg, Germany has been racing against time to try the last Third Reich criminals.Zafke was the fourth former concentration camp worker in the dock in the latest series of trials, following John Demjanjuk in 2011, Oskar Groening in 2015 and Reinhold Hanning this May \u2014 all convicted of complicity in mass murder.Those cases were hailed for providing a degree of catharsis for aged survivors, even if they shed little new light on the Holocaust.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Auschwitz death camp, European Jews, final solution, Hubert Zafke, International Auschwitz Committee, Jewish Diaspora, Nazi-occupied Poland, Nazism, shoaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But the kingdom had the political will to protect children\u2019s rights, he said.The U.N. experts voiced deep concern that Riyadh \u201cstill does not recognise girls as full subjects of rights and continues to severely discriminate (against) them in law and practice and to impose on them a system of male guardianship\u201d.Traditional, religious or cultural attitudes should not be used to justify violations of their right to equality, they said.Children of Shi\u2019ite Muslim families and other religious minorities are persistently discriminated against in their access to schools and justice in the Sunni-ruled kingdom, they said.Children over 15 years are tried as adults and can be executed, \u201cafter trials falling short of guarantees of due process and a fair trial\u201d, the report said.Out of 47 people executed on Jan. 2, 2016 \u2013 the biggest mass execution for security offences in decades, that included a prominent Shi\u2019ite cleric, at least four were under 18 when sentenced to death, it said.The experts urged Saudi authorities to \u201crepeal all provisions contained in legislation which authorise the stoning, amputation and flogging of children\u201d.Saudi Arabia should \u201cunambiguously prohibit the use of solitary confinement, life sentences on children and child attendance of public execution\u201d.All forms of sexual abuse against children should be a crime and perpetrators prosecuted, the experts said.They cited the case of Muslim preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi, saying his charges were reduced and he was released from jail \u201cafter having raped, tortured and killed his five-year-old daughter\u201d in 2012.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Bandar Bin Mohammed Al-Aiban, Convention on the Rights of the Child, human rights, islamic law, Middle East justice, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Human Rights Commission, Sharia LawComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He said Abbas went through a number of routine tests, including a cardiac catheterization, a procedure that can detect and treat heart problems, and that everything looked normal.\u201cHis arteries look great, and there is no need for him to stay in the hospital,\u201d al-Batrawi said.Several hours later, Abbas walked out of the hospital, waving to well-wishers.Abbas did not comment when asked by reporters how he felt.

Thanks to the medical team of the hospital.\u201dAbbas, who has a history of health issues, was elected president in 2005 for what was supposed to be a four-year term. But in 2007 the rival Hamas militant group seized control of the Gaza Strip, and Abbas has remained in power.The Palestinians are now divided between two governments, Abbas\u2019s Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the Hamas government in Gaza. Attempts at reconciliation have repeatedly failed, and this week the Palestinians called off plans to hold municipal elections in the two territories.Abbas, who is a heavy smoker and is overweight, was treated years ago with prostate cancer and has had a stent inserted to treat artery blockage.He also is under great pressure as his popularity has plummeted. The Palestinian public is frustrated over years of failed peace efforts with Israel. Over the past week, he also has come under heavy criticism at home for attending the funeral of the late Israeli president, Shimon Peres.Over the years, Abbas has ignored calls to appoint a successor, setting the stage for a bitter power struggle if he is incapacitated.A long list of senior officials and security chiefs would likely covet the job, though there is no clear front-runner. Perhaps the most popular potential successor, Marwan Barghouti, is serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison for his role in deadly attacks on Israelis. Hamas would also likely demand a say in choosing a new leader. Hamas had no immediate comment Thursday.Even choosing a caretaker leader ahead of future elections will be a difficult task. Under Palestinian law, the parliament speaker is supposed to take over if the president is incapacitated or dies. But the current speaker, Aziz Dweik, is a member of Hamas.Abbas\u2019s Fatah party has argued that since parliament has not functioned in nearly a decade, Dweik would not be eligible to lead the Palestinians.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Gaza Strip, Hamas, Mahmoud Abbas, Marwan Barghouti, Palestinian Authority, Palestinian territoriesComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

In Paris, we celebrate high-end haute couture,\u201d said Jacob Abrian, the head of the Dubai-based Arab Fashion Council (AFC).In Dubai and the Arab world, \u201cwe want to be innovative\u201d, he said, with off-the-rack clothing that is tailored to haute couture standards and can be customised.For the first time in the region, the five-day show will also present a unisex collection signed by Rad Hourani, a Canadian-Jordanian designer known for his genderless creations.The fashion week opened with a \u201cready couture\u201d collection for women from Emirati designer Lamya Abedin in the first of more than 20 Spring/Summer 2017 collections from more than 10 countries.The collection drew applause from an audience of mostly women \u2014 some in mini-dresses and others covered from head to toe in the black traditional Abayas and even a niqab.The show ended with Abedin\u2019s young daughter taking to the catwalk with a model in a peach-coloured lace wedding dress.Now in its third edition, Arab Fashion Week aims to attract fashion conscious women from the Gulf, as well as luxury-orientated buyers from Russia and China.The event, founded in 2014 to represent the fashion industry in the 22 countries of the Arab League, introduced \u201cready couture\u201d after an in-depth study of the market, Abrian said.The form follows in the footsteps of limited ready-to-wear collections that can be customised, from famous fashion houses Roberto Cavalli and Dolce & Gabbana, he said.\u2013 \u2018Peace through fashion\u2019 \u2013AFC spokeswoman Daline Eluar said the group \u201caims to strengthen the role of the UAE, through Dubai, to become the fifth international fashion capital alongside New York, London, Paris and Milan\u201d.The fashion week seeks to show the world that the Arab region is not just \u201cwar and conflicts\u201d but also \u201ccreativity, art and beauty\u201d, she said.The Gulf city state is a growing tourist destination, a magnet for investors and home to one of the world\u2019s largest shopping malls.\u201cDubai has become a fashion capital after international capitals\u201d attracting tourists and designers alike, said Emirati haute couture designer Maryam al-Shaibani who spoke to AFP after the opening show.The cosmopolitan city state has been spared the wave of unrest that has rocked other Arab countries since 2011.Abrian said the AFC wanted to \u201ctailor peace through fashion\u201d by promoting Arab designers and attracting Western brands to manufacture in the region.During the week, the council will promote a Jordan-based initiative to set up the Arab world\u2019s first factory able to manufacture garments to international standards, he said.The initiative is part of a drive towards setting up a creative economy based on the region\u2019s art and culture within 10 years, he added.But much remains to be done, Abrian said, as customers still trust Western designers over their Arab peers.\u201cEverything that comes from Paris, from Milan is more appreciated,\u201d he said.\u2013 \u2018We have reached the world\u2019 \u2013The AFC hopes to counter this by promoting brands that are \u201cmade in Arabia\u201d.Shaibani however appeared more optimistic.\u201cInternational designers are starting to enter the world of Arab fashion designing\u201d by creating garments such as traditional Abayas worn by women in the Gulf region, she said. \u201cThis means that we have reached the world.\u201dEarly this year, Italy\u2019s Dolce & Gabbana launched their first line of hijabs and Abayas for Muslim customers in the Middle East.Islamic fashion will be on display throughout the event with brands from Malaysia and Indonesia, at a time of growing controversy in the West over Muslim women\u2019s clothing.\u201cWe believe that Islamic wear is very important and international brands are targeting\u201d it, said Abrian, adding that Muslim spending on fashion could reach $500 billion annually by 2019.Breitbart Jerusalem, Middle East, Weird News, Arab Fashion Council, Arab Fashion Week, Arab League, Dolce & Gabbana, Dubai, haute couture, uaeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

A capital city is a Western concept, and the importance attributed to it is part of the modern conception of a state.\u201cWe don\u2019t need a state that has a seat in the United Nations, because it has artificial boundaries, while the Islamic state, the Islamic home, has to be portable, flexible and unbound by frontiers. The state, or the house, could govern at night and disappear during the day. That\u2019s what the Taliban do.\u201dAbu Katada added that fixed boundaries play into the hands of the enemy.\u201cThe Mujahideen need to square the circle, the state appears and disappears, governs at night and disappears during the day, the most important thing is to prevent the enemy from taking it over even if he invaded. We may not control some parts of the state, but it\u2019s paramount that we have the ability to hurt the enemy and prevent him from gaining a foothold on the ground.\u201dAbu Katada, who spent some years in a British prison for incitement to terror, said that the state \u201cshould not conform to Western standards, like those of the UN, the Arab League, the World Bank or the International Court of Justice. That would turn it into another Western state, and not an Islamic state that is governed according to God\u2019s criteria.\u201d\u201cThe modern state needs a capital city, international recognition, a currency, and I\u2019m afraid some Islamic organizations are seduced by these,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Islamic state or home don\u2019t need a capital city, they can exist in a small town or village, it doesn\u2019t need representation in the UN General Assembly nor does it need borders. Succumbing to your enemy\u2019s monetary system could allow him to inflict economic damage, even in the event of military gains. The state must be bouncy, unable to be controlled by the enemy.

He is also the director of the Yasser Arafat Foundation, established after his uncle\u2019s death in 2004.Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, and representatives from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have all spoken to Abbas, urging him to name a successor\u00a0in the event of his resignation or if he is deemed unable to continue in office.All four nations assured Abbas that his children will\u00a0be protected when he leaves his position.Former Fatah strongman Mohammad Dahlan, once considered the favored\u00a0candidate to take over the PA, is not likely to be selected, the report said. Dahlan was ousted from Fatah in 2011 following allegations of corruption and murder, and now lives in the United Arab Emirates.In recent months Abbas and Dahlan had been engaged in reconciliation talks in an attempt to prevent Hamas from gaining power ahead of elections in the West Bank and Gaza.However, last week Breitbart Jerusalem reported that Dahlan allegedly told an Egyptian official that Abbas was a \u201ccamel\u201d for regurgitating old ideas.Abbas is approaching his twelfth year as president even though his term ended in 2009. There have not been elections since 2005.On Tuesday, the Palestinian Authority announced that it was suspending municipal elections until further notice. A day earlier, the PA\u2019s High Court said elections would only go ahead in the West Bank and not the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, prompting the Palestinian Central Elections Commission to call on Abbas to delay the elections for at least six months, or until Gaza could be included.The last municipal elections between the two parties occurred in 2006 with Hamas winning, leading to a melee in the Strip bordering on civil war.Big Government, Breitbart Jerusalem, National Security, Arafat's nephew, Egypt, Egypt-Gaza border, Gaza, Gaza Strip, Hamas, High Court, Jordan, Mahmoud Abbas, Pa., Palestinian Authority, ramallah, Syria, Terrorist Organization, uaeComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

He reportedly climbed to a second story window and broke in, according to a report by KXAN NBC in Austin. The incident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. on Sunday morning.After reportedly breaking the window to obtain entry to the capitol, Graeber intentionally damaged the portrait of former Texas Governor Fletcher Stockdale, DPS officials wrote in the arrest affidavit. He then tossed the portrait over the rotunda railing where it fell three stories to crash on the floor. The frame on the portrait was broken, officials stated.Fletcher Stockdale Portrait Courtesy Texas State Preservation Board.A trooper assigned to protect the capitol and a security officer later found the man inside the historic building and arrested him without incident.Graeber was charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief equal to or greater than $2,500 but less than $30,000. If convicted, he could spend up to two years in prison on each count.Fletcher Stockdale served briefly as governor of the Confederate State of Texas in the summer of 1865. He had been elected Lt. Governor in 1863 and succeeded Governor Pendleton Murrah as the state\u2019s chief executive when Murrah fled to Mexico at the end of the Civil War. Murrah, who was suffering tuberculosis at the time, fled to Monterry, Mexico, along with several other leaders of the Confederacy. He died from his illness a few months later, according to the Texas State Historical Association. Stockdale was one of the leaders of the secessionist movement in Texas and served on the committee on resolutions during secession meetings at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina. He served on the committee that drafted the ordinance of secession and was a signatory of the document. Stockdale was succeeded by Governor Andrew Jackson Hamilton, who was appointed as provisional governor by President Andrew Johnson after the surrender of the Confederate States of America to the Union.DPS officials have not stated whether the alleged actions by Graeber had anything specifically to do with Governor Stockdale or any kind of anti-Confederacy sentiment.A records check by Breitbart Texas of the Travis County jail revealed that Graeber is no longer in custody.

Prosecutors presented their argument on the incident which purportedly happened on the previous Friday.The girl told police Appleby\u00a0instructed her to try on three choir robes inside the storage closet he converted into a dressing room. He told her she had to \u201ctake off her bra and panties to make sure it fit correctly,\u201d according to\u00a0KTRK.Prosecutors asserted Appleby secretly filmed the teenager\u00a0after telling her to strip naked\u00a0to try on the robes, KHOU\u00a0reported. The teen apparently requested to change in a\u00a0bathroom but Appleby told her to\u00a0use the\u00a0closet. Prosecutor Angela Weltin later told reporters that Appleby \u201cinstructed her that there were several sizes, to make sure she tried them all on\u201d and to take off all her undergarments \u201cto show no lines in the gown.\u201d \u00a0Weltin said the girl was in the process of changing into her third gown when she noticed a box, inside of which was a video recorder.In the courtroom, prosecutors said the teen\u00a0called her mother on her cell phone to ask for her advice on what to do. Allegedly, the girl\u2019s mother told her to take the camera with her. Appleby noticed the camera and box were missing. According to prosecutors, he confronted her. She turned over the camera to him. Then, the teacher\u00a0and the teen put the memory card in a school computer where the girl claimed she saw herself naked on video, also according to KHOU.\u00a0The prosecution stated Appleby instructed her to delete the video, which she did.Appleby was in his \u201cfifth year of teaching vocal music to young adults\u201d and his \u201cthird year as the Associate Choir Director\u201d at Mayde High School, according to the school\u2019s website, which since removed the\u00a0now former choir teacher\u2019s bio. Appleby previously taught choir in Oklahoma City at Hefner Middle School from 2012-13.\u00a0Under his direction, four choirs received sweepstakes for two consecutive years. He\u00a0was also a finalist for Teacher of the Year in 2013 while working at the Oklahoma middle school, according to the Katy ISD website.Katy ISD\u00a0campus police arrested Appleby, Friday, on the\u00a0charge of felony improper photography.\u00a0He bonded out of jail on $30,000 bail, and the school district fired him. On\u00a0Saturday night, October 8, Katy school district\u00a0officials issued a statement to Mayde High School parents:Dear Mayde Creek High School Parents and Guardians,Yesterday evening the Assistant Choir Director, Clarence Appleby, was arrested by the Katy ISD Police Department for alleged inappropriate use of a visual recording device on campus.Appleby faces a state felony charge for invasive visual recording and was terminated immediately.Thanks to the quick thinking of a student and a parent who informed the school, campus administration was able to work with the Katy ISD Police Department to arrest and charge Appleby.Due to the nature of the incident, not much information can be disclosed at this time, as this continues to be an ongoing investigation, but please rest assured that the safety of all students is our top priority and such allegations are taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly.Parents were shocked by the allegations against Appleby. One mother, Anessa Hall Joseph, told KTRK she hoped this was not true and that something positive would come from this situation.When he first appeared in court on October 7, Appleby did so\u00a0without an attorney, noted\u00a0KHOU. His wife, also a choir teacher at a different school, accompanied him.\u00a0His\u00a0next court date is November 8. If convicted, he\u00a0may face anywhere from six months up to two years in prison, said prosecutors.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Clarence Appleby III, Inappropriate Educator Relationships, Katy ISD, Mayde High School, Teacher-Student Sexual Misconduct, Texas EducationComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The investigation provides harsh criticism of Mexico\u2019s government for being complicit in the cover-up of the crimes. Earlier this year, Breitbart Texas revealed the results of a three month investigation into the Massacre of Allende, where gunmen with the Los Zetas cartel kidnapped, tortured and used ovens, or 55-gallon drums to incinerate their victims. Mainstream media in the U.S. has ignored the Massacre of Allende.The investigation by Breitbart Texas was based on personal interviews as well as U.S. and Mexican court documents that revealed that the leadership of Los Zetas sought to enact revenge on two high ranking associates who had turned themselves over to U.S. authorities in exchange for protection to become informants. The perceived betrayal of the two associates was met with a swift response by the former leader of Los Zetas Miguel Angel \u201cEl 40\u201d Trevino Morales and his brother Omar \u201cEl 42\u201d Trevi\u00f1o Morales. The two men ordered the kidnapping murder of every person who was related to, knew or may have been an acquaintance of the turncoats.  After Breitbart Texas\u2019 report, the Coahuila government was shamed into admitting publicly that between 100 and 150 of the murder victims had been incinerated inside the Piedras Negras prison in 55-gallon drums.In his new report, Mexican activist Sergio Aguayo criticizes the apparent cover-up of the massacre by the Coahuila Government, since the case was largely ignored for more than three years. In contrast, Aguayo presents the swift response of the Mexican government of the Los Zetas execution of 72 illegal immigrants in San Fernando, Tamaulipas in 2010. In that case, in a matter of weeks, the Mexican military managed to arrest dozens of Zetas and corrupt cops tied to the case. Due to his ongoing work in uncovering corruption, Aguayo has been sued by Coahuila\u2019s former governor Humberto Moreira who claims that the activist has slandered him.Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Eduardo Luna has previously been identified as \u201cComandante Pajarito\u201d or Commander Birdie, a lieutenant with Mexico\u2019s Gulf Cartel. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, in March 2015, tourists fishing during spring break at the beach resort city of South Padre Island discovered the body of Juan Francisco \u201cFranklin\u201d Palacios Paz. The victim, who had been previously deported, was tortured and beheaded before being dumped in the water. By November 2015, authorities had arrested Joel Luna\u2013making public the apparent link between a Mexican drug cartel distribution network and the beheading of Palacios. The murder appears to have been linked to a tire shop in the Texas border city of Edinburg that was owned by one of the Luna brothers and may have been used as part of a marijuana smuggling operation.\u00a0During a raid at one of the homes tied to the Luna family, authorities found drugs, cash, a border patrol rifle, badge, and a jeweled handgun. As the trial drew near, some of the defendants, including another of the Luna brothers named Fernando, have agreed to plea guilty to lesser charges. In exchange for Fernando Luna\u2019s guilty plea, he managed to avoid being convicted in connection with the beheading. It appears that once the trial starts, Fernando Luna may be testifying against his two brothers.Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

The court earlier ordered work to stop while it considered the motion.In a statement, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II said that the tribe \u201cis not backing down from this fight.\u201d\u201cWe will not rest until our lands, people, waters and sacred places are permanently protected from this destructive pipeline,\u201d Archambault said.Owned by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, the $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile project would carry nearly a half-million barrels of crude oil daily from North Dakota\u2019s oil fields through South Dakota and Iowa to an existing pipeline in Patoka, Illinois, where shippers can access Midwest and Gulf Coast markets.The company did not immediately return an email Sunday seeking comment on the court\u2019s decision.The pipeline passes near Standing Rock Sioux reservation land that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The tribe\u2019s protest encampment near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers has swelled to thousands at times as demonstrators from around the country joined their cause.Tribal and state officials also are at odds over whether sacred sites were destroyed while digging the pipeline corridor. The state archaeologist has said an inspection found no sign that the area contained human remains or cultural artifacts.Congressman Kevin Cramer applauded the ruling. \u201cI look forward to the workers getting back to work, doing the jobs they need to do Monday morning,\u201d the North Dakota Republican said in a statement.The court hasn\u2019t decided on the tribe\u2019s appeal of a September ruling by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who declined to shut down work on the entire pipeline. He said the Sioux hadn\u2019t demonstrated that an injunction was warranted.Though work may resume, three federal agencies \u2014 Interior, Justice and Army \u2014 immediately ordered that construction stop on land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers next to and underneath Lake Oahe as it reviews its permitting decisions.No timetable has been set for the federal review.Follow Breitbart Texas on Twitter @BreitbartTexas.Breitbart Texas, Environment, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Bakken, dallas, dog bites, Energy Transfer, Energy Transfer Partners, Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Illinois, Iowa, Morton County Sherriff\u2019s Office, Native Americans, North Dakota, Pepper Spray, pepper-sprayed, pipeline, pipeline protest, protest, security dogs, South Dakota, Standing Rock Sioux, Three Affiliated Tribes, Three Forks, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Department of the InteriorComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The Breitbart News article written two years ago in October states, \u201c[W]hat is even more appalling is that, so far, the site has gone largely unpunished by law enforcement for their facilitation of this despicable criminal activity. The \u2018adult\u2019 section of the site has become a horrific hub for the sex trafficking industry as women and children are being illegally sold for sex through classified ads posted to their page.\u201dThe bust by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was the largest human trafficking bust in the Lone Star State\u2019s history, as reported by Breitbart Texas.\u00a0Almost 35 members of the Texas AG\u2019s Law Enforcement Unit participated in the arrest of Backpage\u2019s CEO. They also executed a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of the business at 2501 Oak Lawn Avenue. A search reveals that Ferrer is no longer in the Harris County, Texas jail. The Sacramento Bee reports that he is in a Sacramento jail and is being held without bail.Backpage is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in the United States.\u00a0Backpage.com\u00a0has its principal place of business in Dallas but it is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation (LLC).The website operates a worldwide online classified advertising site. Among other ads, people can post or locate adult escort advertisement services.\u00a0An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by Breitbart Texas stated, \u201cIt is currently the single largest purveyor of Internet sex ads in the United States, and\u00a0Backpage.com\u2019s profits from this line of business register in the millions yearly.\u201dThe Texas and California attorneys general worked together on a lengthy investigation and found evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the website a \u201cdeep-seated evil\u201d and \u201cmodern-day slavery.\u201d He explained that the victims that are sex trafficked include both voluntary and involuntary participants and minors.The probable cause stated within the affidavit for a search warrant stated included that Backpage.com\u00a0receives more than 90% of their revenues from adult escort ads. Just in California, those revenues for January 2013 to May 31, 2015 was $50 million, or between $1.5 to $2.5 million per month. It stated that Ferrer has been the CEO of the website since 2012 but has handled the day-to-day operations for the company for a much longer period. All business and financial records of shareholders Ferrer, Jim Larkin and Michael Lacey were targeted in the affidavit for search warrant.It also said that \u201cFerrer\u2019s communications and emails obtained by search warrant, his interactions with law enforcement, and even the public statements of his high level executives, such as his General Counsel, reflect personal knowledge that\u00a0Backpage.com derives support or maintenance from the earnings of people engaged in prostitution.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s Pimping statute provides that it is a criminal offense \u201cknowing another person is a prostitute,\u201d to \u201clive, derive support or maintenance from the earnings or proceeds of a person\u2019s prostitution,\u201d or to \u201csolicit or receive compensation for soliciting for the person.\u201d Ferrer faces a sentence from between three to eight years of imprisonment under the California felony pimping statute.In Texas, Ferrer also faces money laundering charges. Pimping qualifies as a \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under the Texas Penal Code section for money laundering because it is an offense \u201cpunishable by confinement for more than one year under the laws of another state.\u201d The credit cards, gift cards, debit cards, Bitcoin, and cash used to purchase ads for prostitution on Backpage.com all qualify as \u201cfunds\u201d under the Texas Penal Code.\u00a0Under the Texas Money Laundering statute, the court can consider all $50 million generated by the websites\u2019s adult escort section in California when classifying this offense because it constitutes an ongoing business model and a continuing course of conduct, says the affidavit. \u201cIf proceeds of criminal activity are related to one scheme or continuing course of conduct, whether from the same or several sources, the conduct may be considered as one offense and the value of the proceeds aggregated in determining the classification of the offense.\u201dAn offense in Texas for money laundering is a felony of the first degree if the value of the funds is $300,000 or more. Conviction would be punishable in prison time from five to 99 years up to life, and a fine of up to $10,000.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

More than\u00a068,000 fraud complaints have been filed in the region in the region from at least 40 disasters since 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina.Green said that over 50,000 of those complaints have been referred to local authorities and law enforcement agencies.Scammers following disasters usually come in the form of federal emergency aid and phony contractors who are looking to scam homeowners.Green told the media that fraudsters are already defrauding residents who have seen disaster during Hurricane Matthew. He said they have already received one call coming in about a scam.This is not the first case where Louisiana flood victims have seen more than just flood disaster, but also a blackout of media coverage, obliviousness from politicians and a lack of monetary help from donors.As Breitbart Texas reported, donations for Louisiana\u2019s 2016 flood victims have been far less compared to the donations that came in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy.Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been largely criticized for their slow response and lack of help to Louisiana flood victims, as Breitbart Texas reported.Almost a month after the storm touched down in the region, FEMA had only set up one \u201cmanufactured housing unit\u201d in the area, despite more than 100,000 damaged homes and 60,000 homes fully destroyed.Two weeks after the storm, more than 1,400 residents remained in shelters, as a large number of homeowners did not carry flood insurance because the region had never flooded in the past.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The boy was airlifted to a hospital in Monterrey for a gunshot wound to the chest. Carlos Miguel Velazquez Aguilar, 6, received some superficial injuries to his head and remains at a local hospital with his aunt Duna Maria Aguilar Agueta. The woman said that she and her two nephews had travelled from Honduras in an effort to get to the border in an effort to cross illegally into McAllen, Texas. Emergency medical personnel also treated 14-year-old Andy William Tovara Bautista and German Tovara Pacheco who had also been injured. Law enforcement sources consulted by Breitbart Texas revealed that just minutes before the fatal chase, there had been a gun battle in the city of Linares, just 15 miles away. Preliminary information points to the officers having been warned about the possible presence of fleeing gunmen. In the aftermath of the shooting, Martinez has been arrested and charged with\u00a0of abuse of authority and injury to a child. The Public Safety Director from the city of General Teran, Enrique Sanmiguel resigned from his post immediately after the shooting.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

Federal authorities filed the action just one week to the day before the Texas AG was to represent the Lone Star State and half the states in their fight at the U.S. Supreme Court against President Obama\u2019s Administration\u2019s executive\u00a0amnesty order.As reported by Breitbart News, the executive amnesty case was historic because this was only the second time in U.S. history where America\u2019s highest court was to decide a challenge brought by a majority of states against the federal government. It was also historic in that it involved the scope of presidential power under the U.S. Constitution.The motion to dismiss filed by lead counsel Matthew T. Martens\u00a0(Washington, D.C.), Dallas lawyer William B. Mateja, and Frisco lawyer J. Mitchell Little, urged that the federal complaint for securities fraud \u201cdoes not allege that [Paxton] made a single false or misleading statement.\u201d The complaint did however, accuse Servergy\u2019s co-founder and then-CEO and Chairman William E. Mapp, III, of leading investors to believe that a \u201crevolutionary new server\u201d \u201cwas in high demand.\u201d It stated that Mapp falsely claimed that notable companies like Amazon.com and Freescale Semiconductors had pre-ordered the product. This was just one of the misrepresentations alleged by the SEC against Mapp in the complaint.In June Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported, that Paxton\u2019s lawyers, including Martens who had\u00a0previously served as the chief litigation counsel in the enforcement division at the SEC, filed a motion to dismiss the SEC civil lawsuit (with prejudice). He wrote, \u201cIn short, the SEC\u2019s claims against Mr. Paxton are a dramatic overreach and lack any basis in law.\u201dPaxton\u2019s lawyers filed the\u00a029-page pleading and urged that the SEC had not claimed that Paxton ever lied or made a misrepresentation, and no one had alleged that they lost money in any of the transactions involving Paxton. The motion also stated that the SEC\u2019s argument that Paxton failed to disclose that he could receive a commission for touting securities, and that he had not investigated the company, ran counter to decades of case law precedent that has never required such discussions or actions.Federal regulators say Paxton raised $840,000 for Servergy, a high-tech startup, without telling investors that he was being paid. They alleged Paxton was paid\u00a0100,000 shares for bringing on investors in 2011.In the Court\u2019s order, the Judge Amos L. Mazzant, III (an Obama appointee) wrote, \u201cThis case is not about whether Paxton had a moral obligation to disclose his financial\u00a0arrangement with Servergy to potential investors. This case is also not about whether Paxton had\u00a0some general obligation to disclose his financial arrangement to his investor group. The only\u00a0issue before the Court is to determine whether the facts as pleaded give rise to a plausible claim\u00a0under federal securities laws. With that limitation in mind, the Court has determined that under\u00a0the facts pleaded by the Commission, Paxton did not have a legal obligation to disclose his\u00a0financial arrangement.\u201dThe Court concluded \u201cthat the Complaint has not alleged facts sufficient to support a plausible\u00a0claim under Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act or Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the\u00a0Exchange Act.\u201dThe SEC asked the Court to give it an opportunity to amend its Complaint and the federal judge responded saying that \u201cWhile this request does not satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of\u00a0Civil Procedure 15, the Court is inclined to allow the Commission to plead additional facts, if\u00a0any, before it grants the motion and dismisses the Commission\u2019s claims against Paxton.\u201dThe Court ordered that Paxton\u2019s Motion to Dismiss was conditionally granted \u201cpending the Court\u2019s review of the\u00a0Commission\u2019s submission of additional facts.\u201d He granted the Commission \u201cleave to\u00a0amend its allegations against Paxton to the extent that it has additional facts that might support a\u00a0claim under the statutes alleged in the Complaint.\u201d\u201cThis is a victory for Ken Paxton. Obviously, we are pleased with the Court\u2019s ruling today,\u201d said Matthew Martens.\u00a0Bill Mateja, a lawyer on both Paxton\u2019s SEC and criminal defense teams added \u201cnow we turn our attention to Ken\u2019s exoneration in the state matter where the prosecutor\u2019s burden is even higher. The fraud allegations in the SEC case mirror those in the state case.\u201dAny amendment to the Complaint by the Commission was ordered to be filed within 14 days of the October 7th order.The Judge also ordered that \u201cthe Commission must place any new facts not\u00a0previously alleged in the original Complaint in bold typeface.\u201dLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Game 3 is Sunday night.A reminder, though: Last year, Toronto lost the first two games of the ALDS at home against Texas, then rallied to win the series.Osuna entered after reliever Francisco Liriano was hit in the neck by Carlos Gomez\u2019s line drive. It was Osuna\u2019s first appearance since he left the mound in the AL wild-card win Tuesday night with a shoulder injury, putting his status in doubt.Kevin Pillar, Ezequiel Carrera and Encarnacion, who ended the wild-card game with a three-run homer in the 11th inning, hit solo homers in a five-batter span in the fifth. Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s two-run drive in the second put 20-game winner J.A. Happ and the Blue Jays ahead to stay.Texas scored twice in the eighth, including Gomez\u2019s single that struck Liriano. The pitcher walked off the mound, and an ambulance was waiting to take him to the hospital after the game.A day after Cleveland homered three times in an inning against Boston and won its ALDS opener, the Blue Jays matched the feat on a dreary, misty afternoon in Texas.The home runs boosted the Blue Jays in a game in which they got outhit 13-6.Happ allowed nine hits but only run while pitching into the sixth. The left-hander struck out five and walked one.Darvish had as many strikeouts (four) in his five innings as homers allowed, becoming the first pitcher in the postseason to allow four homers in a game since Minnesota\u2019s Rick Reed against Oakland in Game 3 of the 2002 ALDS.Texas has lost five straight ALDS games to the Blue Jays since winning the first two games in Toronto last October. The Rangers dropped to 1-11 in ALDS games in their home ballpark.Osuna likely came in earlier than manager John Gibbons had planned, a move that followed Liriano getting struck.The ball off Gomez\u2019s bat was measured at 102 mph, and Liriano turned away just in time to avoid being hit in the face. Gomez winced as the ball caromed into right-center field to make it 5-2.Ian Desmond drove in a run with a grounder before Osuna struck out Carlos Beltran to end the eighth.Adrian Beltre was stranded at second after a leadoff double in the ninth.Toronto opened the series with 10-1 win on Thursday, when Cole Hamels gave up seven runs in 3 1-3 innings. It was the worst postseason outing ever for the All-Star lefty who was the MVP of both the World Series and NLCS for Philadelphia in 2008.Pillar started the homer frenzy in the fifth with a leadoff shot, his first drive since June 16 \u2014 a span of 79 games. Carrera hit a one-out shot into the Rangers bullpen in right-center field and Encarnacion hit a ball just over the wall and inside the left-field pole to make it 5-0.After a bases-clearing triple in the opener, Tulowitzki got the Jays started in Game 2 with his homer that made it 2-0. Jose Bautista, 1 for 20 with nine strikeouts in his career against Darvish, had led off the second with a walk.TRAINER\u2019S ROOMBlue Jays: 2B Devon Travis was scratched from the starting lineup about an hour before first pitch because of right knee irritation.Rangers: RF Shin-Soo Choo was out of the lineup after playing Game 1, but manager Jeff Banister said Choo was fine physically. Choo was on the disabled list four times this year, and had missed 39 games with a broken left forearm until last weekend.UP NEXTBlue Jays: One of the two losses by RHP Aaron Sanchez was to Texas, when he gave up a season high-matching six runs and was the loser in that May 15 game with the bench-clearing brawl after Bautista was punched by Rougned Odor.Rangers: RHP Colby Lewis, who starts game 3, is 4-1 with a 2.38 ERA in nine career postseason games (eight starts) for Texas. In 2010, he won the AL Championship Series clincher to get the Rangers to their first World Series, and beat San Francisco in Game 3 for their only victory in that series.Breitbart Sports, Breitbart TexasComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The agency had previously claimed an 81 percent success rate, the AP reported.Members of Congress had demanded the 98-page report be released after it was completed nearly five months ago.\u201cDHS does not believe it is in the public interest to release, and it would be irresponsible to make policy or other judgments on the basis of analysis that is incomplete and remains a work in progress,\u201d DHS Spokesman Marsha Catron told the AP on Thursday.The report appears to confirm the popular sentiment that borders are not secure. During FY 2017, 170,000 illegal aliens eluded DHS law enforcement agencies by crossing the border without detection or capture. Another 30,000 entered without being captured at ports of entry or via sea crossings, the report states.The report does show a decline in the numbers of uncaptured illegal aliens. The FY 2015 numbers were down from the previous year\u2019s number of 260,000. They were significantly down from FY 2005 when 1.9 million entered without being captured.Some of those decreases can be credited to increased law enforcement along the border, but much of it is also a reflection of the weakened American economy wrought by the Great Recession.The AP\u2019s analysis of the report states, \u201cThe Border Patrol achieved an 11-point improvement in 2014 after years of slow but steady gains. The report does not offer an explanation for the sudden improvement.\u201dWhat that analysis ignores is the phenomena that began in 2014 when huge numbers of unaccompanied minors and incomplete family units flooded across the border to literally turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents at the border. These numbers alone could have a significant impact on the percentage of those captured versus those who were allowed to escape into the country undetected.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Deputies became suspicious because the alleged drug trafficker had already passed the two Gulfport exits.Ceron told police she had purchased the vehicle she was driving three months earlier after she quit her job and claimed she was coming to the United States to take care of her mother. Ceron continued to tell police that she had recently began working for an accountant in Mexico instead.That\u2019s when Ceron said she was planning to take a trip to Pensacola to visit the beach, but the police found no evidence of a swimsuit or beach attire in her vehicle for such plans.

The Los Zeta gunmen began shooting at the troops in an effort to elude capture, setting off a fierce firefight. The exchange of bullets damaged various houses and cars in the neighborhood yet no civilians were injured. At the end of the skirmish, two of the Los Zetas gunmen had been killed. Emergency personnel rushed Communications Specialist Yovani Calderon, a Mexican soldier, to a local hospital. The soldier received a a gunshot wound that proved to be fatal. Mexican authorities continued to search for the Los Zetas shooters through the night.Communications Specialist Yovani CalderonCalderon\u2019s murder comes just days after the Mexican Military released new statistics that place the border state of Tamaulipas as the entity with the most soldiers killed. Since 2012, Tamaulipas has seen 24 soldiers killed; Jalisco is the second state with the most casualties at 17 soldiers killed in the line of duty. Breitbart Texas recently reported on a cartel ambush in Culiacan, Sinaloa. In that attack, at least 60 gunmen with the Sinaloa Cartel ambushed a convoy of 17 Mexican soldiers who were escorting an ambulance that had been transporting an injured cartel lieutenant. The gunmen killed five soldiers and injured 10 others. Last month, Breitbart Texas reported on another cartel gun battle in the border city of Reynosa where another Mexican soldier was killed. The results of a forensic investigation that Breitbart Texas had access to revealed that the soldier was killed by friendly fire.

Preliminary information points to the teen running away with Guerra, however due to her age, the case became criminal in nature. Guerra has since been charged with one count of aggravated kidnapping, her bond was set at $200,000.In response to the kidnapping, Texas cops reached out to their counterparts in Mexico. Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office (PGR) issued an Amber alert in an effort to locate the missing teen.According to information released by the Tamaulipas government, members of the state police unit located the teen at a a local business that belonged to a relative of Guerra. The relative told authorities that Guerra had convinced the teen to return to Texas to avoid getting in trouble with authorities. Mexican authorities claim they took Guerra to one of the local bridges for her arrest by Texas authorities.

He had an RBI single in Toronto\u2019s five-run third off All-Star left-hander Cole Hamels.Bautista added a 425-foot blast in the ninth inning, and the Blue Jays slugger seemed to deliberately drop the bat softly near home plate after his second homer of this postseason.Troy Tulowitzki hit a bases-loaded triple for the Blue Jays. Toronto has won four straight overall, including an 11-inning, 5-2 victory over Baltimore in the AL wild-card game Tuesday night.Estrada, also an All-Star pitcher this season, limited Texas to four hits, the last Elvis Andrus\u2019 leadoff triple in the ninth. Manager John Gibbons removed the right-hander after Shin-Soo Choo\u2019s RBI grounder ended the shutout bid.Estrada has never pitched a complete game in the majors and the Blue Jays didn\u2019t throw one this season. No matter, Estrada gave them all they needed to start this best-of-five series.Toronto had to win its last two regular-season games at AL East champion Boston just to make the playoffs. The Blue Jays then won at home this week when Edwin Encarnacion hit a game-ending, three-run homer to beat Baltimore.Bautista was booed heartily during pregame introductions and while he batted in the first inning. There also were chants of \u201cRougie! Rougie!\u201d \u2014 those were for Rougned Odor, the second baseman who punched Bautista and ignited a bench-clearing brawl in their last meeting May 15. Odor was suspended seven games.By time Bautista led off the seventh with a walk, the ballpark was quiet with the Rangers down 7-0. After he homered, a fan threw the ball almost back to the infield.The only hit Estrada allowed in the first six innings came when Adrian Beltre led off the second with a soft grounder to the right side of the infield, when the pitcher didn\u2019t get over to cover the base.Texas didn\u2019t have another hit until Carlos Beltran singled in the seventh, but was promptly erased by a double play.Hamels, the MVP of the 2008 World Series and NLCS for Philadelphia, threw 42 of his 82 pitches in the third. He allowed seven runs (six earned) with three walks in 3 1/3 innings.Ezequiel Carrera was on second base with two outs in the third when Josh Donaldson hit a liner toward base. Donaldson had even stopped running, assuming that Beltre would catch the ball \u2014 instead, the rising liner ricocheted off the mitt of the four-time Gold Glover and into left field for an RBI double that made it 1-0.Encarnacion then had a single on a liner off Hamels\u2019 outstretched glove, before Bautista\u2019s run-scoring single and Russell Martin\u2019s walk to load the bases.Tulowitzki followed with a triple deep into the right-center gap on a ball that All-Star center fielder Ian Desmond might have lost when running out of the sun and into the shadows while getting close to the wall during the late afternoon.Melvin Upton Jr. homered starting the Toronto sixth before Andrus\u2019 one-out throwing error from shortstop allowed leadoff hitter Devon Travis to reach.Donaldson, who had four hits and walked, then had an RBI double to chase Hamels. Alex Claudio then pitched 3 2-3 scoreless innings.When Texas had errors on three consecutive plays in that shaky seventh inning of Game 5 last October, leading up to Bautista\u2019s homer, Andrus had two of them. Andrus had misplayed a grounder to start that frame, and dropped an easy toss on what would have been a sure force out.TRAINER\u2019S ROOMBlue Jays: Closer Roberto Osuna came out of the AL wild-card with shoulder soreness, and it was never clear beforehand if the right-hander was available for the ALDS opener.

The Texas and California attorneys general worked together on a lengthy investigation and found evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution. Backpage.com allegedly did so thorough escort ads on its website.\u201cMaking money off the backs of innocent human beings by allowing them to be exploited for modern-day slavery is not acceptable in Texas,\u201d Attorney General Paxton said. \u201cI intend to use every resource my office has to make sure those who profit from the exploitation and trafficking of persons are held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\u201dAlmost 35 members of the Texas AG\u2019s Law Enforcement Unit participated in the arrest of Backpage\u2019s CEO. They also executed a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of the business at 2501 Oak Lawn Avenue, Dallas, Texas.Backpage is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in North America.\u00a0Backpage.com is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation (LLC), incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Dallas. It operates a worldwide online classified ad site on which people can post or locate an adult escort advertisement, among other things. An affidavit for a search warrant stated, \u201cIt is currently the single largest purveyor of Internet sex ads in the United States, and Backpage.com\u2019s profits from this line of business register in the millions yearly.\u201dAn affidavit for a search warrant obtained by Breitbart Texas asked for items that were believed to be implements or instruments used in the commission of a crime, namely money laundering and prostitution or pimping. All business and financial records pertaining to Backpage.com, its parent companies or companies that have an invested interest in\u00a0Backpage.com were targeted, as well as all business and financial documents pertaining or related to\u00a0Backpage.com shareholders, namely Carl Ferrer, Jim Larkin, and Michael Lacey.The affidavit completed by a peace officer also asked for all identifying documents and images that related to Backpage or its parent companies. Cell phones, SIM cards and other memory cards or equipment related to cell phones in the care, custody, or control of Ferrer were also sought.Any documents showing what person or persons exercise control over the business, and all computer hardware, and all digital storage device passwords and other data security devices designed to restrict access to or hide computer, were also laid out in the affidavit.The affidavit included a request that \u201cmembers of the California Department of Justice and California Attorney General\u2019s Office be permitted to accompany Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office agents in the execution of this search warrant and that any evidence seized, be shared with California Attorney General\u2019s Office and any law enforcement personnel working at their direction.\u201dSergeant Cora Gray, the affiant, is assigned to the Human Trafficking and Transnational/Organized Crime Section, Criminal Investigations Division at the Office of the Attorney General of Texas.The Sergeant is specially-trained in the area of trafficking and has, over the last four years, conducted hundreds of searches on Backpage.com and followed tips to search for missing and exploited children.The probable cause stated within the affidavit for a search warrant includes (among other things):The adult escort ads posted on Backpage.com are advertisements for prostitution, the exchange of sexual acts for a fee. People engaged in prostitution pay Backpage.com to post advertisements soliciting potential buyers for their sexual services.Backpage receives more than 90% of their revenues from the adult escort ad portion of their classified advertising. In California, that amounts to approximately $50 million in revenues for the period between January 2013 to May 31, 2015, or between $1.5 to $2.5 million per month.CARL FERRER has been the CEO of Backpage.com since 2012, but has handled the day-to-day operations for the company for much longer. Carl Ferrer has been told directly by law enforcement about prostitution on Backpage.com, and is regularly copied on the hundreds of law enforcement subpoenas and requests that Backpage.com receives each year related to prostitution and sex trafficking of both adults and minors on the website. Ferrer\u2019s communications and emails obtained by search warrant, his interactions with law enforcement, and even the public statements of his high level executives, such as his General Counsel, reflect personal knowledge that Backpage.com derives support or maintenance from the earnings of people engaged in prostitution.California\u2019s Pimping statute provides that it is a criminal offense \u201cknowing another person is a prostitute,\u201d to \u201clive, derive support or maintenance from the earnings or proceeds of a person\u2019s prostitution,\u201d or to \u201csolicit or receive compensation for soliciting for the person.\u201d California\u2019s crime of pimping is a felony punishable between three to eight years of imprisonment.Pimping qualifies as a \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under the Texas Penal Code section for Money Laundering because it is an offense \u201cpunishable by confinement for more than one year under the laws of another state.\u201d The credit cards, gift cards, debit cards, Bitcoin, and cash used to purchase ads for prostitution on Backpage.com all qualify as \u201cfunds\u201d under the Texas Penal Code.Under the Texas Money Laundering statute, the court can consider all $50 million generated by Backpage.com\u2019s adult escort section in the state of California when classifying this offense because it constitutes an ongoing business model and a continuing course of conduct, says the affidavit. \u201cIf proceeds of criminal activity are related to one scheme or continuing course of conduct, whether from the same or several sources, the conduct may be considered as one offense and the value of the proceeds aggregated in determining the classification of the offense.\u201dUnder the Texas Money Laundering statute, an offense under this section is:1. a state jail felony if the value of the funds is $2,500 or more but less than $30,000;2. a felony of the third degree if the value of the funds is $30,000 or more but less than $150,000;3. a felony of the second degree if the value of the funds is $150,000 or more but less than $300,000; or4. a felony of the first degree if the value of the funds is $300,000 or more.The investigation began after there were reports from law enforcement agencies, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and news stories about children who were repeatedly exploited for commercial sex on Backpage.com.The affidavit also says that \u201cSince 2012, NCMEC has worked on more than 400 cases involving children sold for commercial sex on Backpage.com. During this same time period, NCMEC has reported 2,900 instances to California law enforcement where suspected child sex trafficking occurred via Backpage.com.Law enforcement officials state that Backpage.com describes itself in public presentations and internal documents as the second largest online classified advertising service in the country.Last January, Attorney General Paxton launched a Human Trafficking and Transnational/Organized Crime (HTTOC) unit. The division works closely with prosecutors around the state to bring human traffickers to arrest and trial.Most recently, HTTOC worked with the Nueces County District Attorney\u2019s Office to secure a 40-year sentence for the trafficker of a 15-year-old victim.In July 2015, Breitbart Texas reported that a\u00a0former Galveston County judge had been charged with posting online ads indicating an ex-girlfriend, and a woman who had spurned his advances, were available for sexual services for pay.\u00a0The controversial ex-judge was arrested on two counts of felony online impersonation.In early September, Attorney General Paxton met with a group of truckers who are committed to help spot and report human trafficking on the highways, reported Breitbart Texas. Law enforcement professionals and truck drivers working together has proven to be an effective tool to stop the trafficking and abuse of many young girls in this country.\u00a0Paxton\u2019s office has conducted more than 50 training sessions statewide since the beginning of 2016. More than 4,000 truck drivers and other Texans have been trained on what to look for when encountering potentially trafficked victims.The Office of Attorney General (OAG)\u00a0website lists the four types of trafficking\u00a0under Texas law:Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Through investigation, officers learned both teens had each worn the mask at one point.They also found Defelice had posted a photo on Snapchat Tuesday morning of one of the two wearing the mask while riding in Defelice\u2019s truck.The two teenagers are now facing a sentence of no less than six months in prison with a maximum of three years, Sheriff Craig Webre said in a news release.\u201cLast week we issued a stern warning that this \u2018creepy clown\u2019 activity would not be tolerated and violators would be charged,\u201d Webre said in a statement. \u201cWith rumors running rampant throughout the country, these individuals are deciding to exploit public fears for some sort of personal enjoyment, and that is simply despicable.

Almost immediately, the suspect reportedly produced a pistol and \u201cshot Officer Snyder point blank,\u201d St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told a reporter from KMOV CBS4.A second officer arrived on the scene as Snyder was shot. That officer returned fire, striking the suspect several times. The officer and the suspect were transported to area hospitals. Officer Snyder died from his single gunshot wound while the suspect remains in critical condition.\u201cFrom the time the suspect made it from the house to car, that\u2019s where Officer Snyder encountered him,\u201d Chief Belmar told reporters. \u201cOfficer Snyder, we believe at this point in the investigation, gave the suspect some commands because he couldn\u2019t see his hands. The suspect produced a pistol and he shot Officer Snyder point-blank. It was an immediately fatal wound.\u201dThe chief told reporters that paramedics worked diligently to save the officer. Doctors at St. Anthony\u2019s Hospital worked on the dying officer for more than an hour, but were unsuccessful in their efforts.Breitbart Texas reached out to the St. Louis County Police Department for more information about the alleged shooter. A response was not immediately available. The only description currently available is that the alleged shooter is an 18-year-old male, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Thursday morning. An update to that story indicates the 911 call came from the house of a girl who had a relationship with the reported suspect.St. Louis County Police Sergeant Shawn McGuire told the Post-Dispatch reporters that Snyder has been shot one time in the chin at \u201cvery close range.\u201d The incident occurred shortly after a 5 a.m. 911 call reported a man banging on the doors of a house trying to get in. Officer Snyder radioed minutes later that he had arrived at the scene.Chief Belmar told reporters in a press conference that the suspect was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a car when Officer Snyder arrived. The officer reportedly ordered the suspect to show his hands. Sgt. McGuire told the reporters the suspect then pulled a gun and fired one time, striking Snyder in the chin. Neither of the officers were wearing body cameras and the police cars are not equipped with dash cameras.McGuire said the suspect was the target of a drug investigation that Officer Snyder was involved in. He did not say if that played a role in the shooting. Responding to questions, Sgt. McGuire said the suspect was shot \u201ca lot.\u201d He is listed in critical but stable condition.The home is in a middle-class community. One neighbor, Mike Miller, told the Post-Dispatch reporters the home where the shooting occurred was one of the few trouble spots in the neighborhood. He told the reporters that a woman with a teenager and other children live there and the house is suspected of being a drug house. He said two youths were caught smoking marijuana in a car outside the home recently.Former Missouri State Representative Vicki Englund, who also currently serves on the local school board, also lives near the home where the shooting occurred. She was awakened to the sound of gunfire shortly after 5 a.m. Thursday. She heard the shots and then the voice of what she believed to be a police officer yelling orders at someone to get back in their home.\u201cI heard couple shots then a pause then I heard 10 or so in a row and someone yell \u2018Get back in the house\u2019 or \u2018Are you gonna get back in the house?\u2019 in a very strong, controlled voice,\u201d she told the local newspaper. \u201cAnd then a few more shots.\u201dA post on the county police department\u2019s Facebook page stated Officer Snyder was a four-year veteran. He leaves behind a grieving widow and a son. While a GoFundMe page has been established by a Facebook user, the department officially request that anyone wishing to make a donation do so through the local Backstoppers organization.Officer Snyder is the 97th law enforcement officer to die in the line of duty this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. He is the 42nd to be killed by gunfire. He was the 10th St. Louis County police officer to be killed in the line of duty since the department\u2019s inception in 1955 \u2013 the first since the Halloween night shooting of Sergeant Richard Weinhold, 44, who was also responding to a disturbance call.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

In a statement, the Kerrville Fire Marshal said the juvenile, whose identity has not been released, is \u201cresponsible for causing the victim\u2019s severe burns,\u201d WOAI reported.More than 20 percent of 10-year-old Kayden Culp\u2019s body was seriously burned, from his ears to his belly button, said his mother Tristyn Hatchett. The incident happened on Sunday afternoon, October 2. Culp was rushed to University Hospital in San Antonio where doctors placed him in a drug induced coma and on a ventilator.Culp\u2019s family maintain\u00a0the attack was planned.\u201cThe other kids are saying that he was going to be riding his bike like he always is, my nephew Kayden is going to be riding his bike, and they said we\u2019re going to grab him and take him inside and burn him,\u201d said Culp\u2019s aunt Kelly Mack, to WOAI. Previously, they stated Culp\u00a0was purposefully doused with gasoline and set on fire.Kerrville authorities do not believe the incident was premeditated or that there was\u00a0any intent to harm any of the four male juveniles \u201cpresent at the time of the incident on Sunday\u201d when Culp was\u00a0severely\u00a0burned.Thursday morning,\u00a0Kerrville Fire Chief Dannie Smith, Police Chief David Knight, and Fire Marshal Chris Lee spoke to reporters. They stated they\u00a0believe what happened was that the boys lit a shed on fire and then threw gasoline on it. Smith reiterated they have not been able to produce any evidence to show there was any intent to commit bodily injury to any of the juveniles involved.Smith said\u00a0the Fire Marshal\u2019s office made the determination to charge the youth with first degree arson based on criteria including that the boy in question \u201ccommitted an offense by starting a fire or causes an explosion with the intent to destroy or damage any building, habitation, or vehicle.\u201d Smith cited the youngster\u2019s intentional \u201crecklessness\u201d in setting a fire, destroying property, and causes another person to suffer bodily injury or death. The\u00a0investigation remains ongoing. Because juveniles are involved, officers cannot share further information.Previously, it was reported Culp was a\u00a0special needs child. According to WOAI, Hatchett said her son exhibits autistic behavior but has not been diagnosed. She said he also has trouble speaking and hearing.Wednesday evening, WOAI reported family members said Culp\u2019s condition worsened. They said his\u00a0organs were failing as his body was fighting infections. The boy remained in a medically-induced coma and on life support.A YouCaring crowdfunding page was set up with a $10,000 goal to help the affected family with medical expenses. As of press time, the site raised nearly $105,000 and received 6,600 shares.Thursday morning, physicians said the boy\u2019s heart and blood pressure stabilized. Culp\u2019s mother posted an update on the fundraising site.She wrote:\u00a0Kayden is doing a little better today. They have taken him off the epinephrine. He was able to stabilize his heart rate and blood pressure on his own all night. Still on feeding and breathing machines. He is going in for his second dressing change soon. We will know more about the severity of his burns and lung damage afterwards. His swelling seems to be reducing now. The last dressing change caused him to plummet.

The charge rose from an incident where Matthews is alleged to have used a vehicle to attack two family members. He was also wanted on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and deadly conduct involving the discharge of a firearm, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).Shortly after being named to the top-10 list, law enforcement officers received a tip as to Matthews\u2019 whereabouts. Special agents from the Texas DPS Criminal Investigation Division closed in on the Aryan Brotherhood member and took him into custody without incident on the northwest side of Houston.Matthews is no stranger to the Texas prison system. Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas from Harris County District Clerk Chris Daniel\u2019s office revealed the gang member had an extensive criminal history. His record includes felony convictions of Burglary, Possession of a Controlled Substance, Evading Arrest, and Theft. He also has a record of misdemeanor charges of Assault on a Family Member, Trespass of a Building, Assault with Bodily Injury, and Theft.Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the criminal activities of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas (ABT). In April 2013, an FBI document linking the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas with Mexican drug cartels was revealed. Despite the racist aspects of the gang\u2019s history, they tend to ignore race when engaging in their criminal activities.\u201cSeveral law enforcement\u00a0personnel\u00a0from the FBI and other agencies confirmed with Breitbart News that the Aryan Brotherhood\u2019s criminal activities are seldom driven by race; their focuses are drug and sex trafficking, as well as murder-for-hire,\u201d Breitbart reported at the time.Photographs showing neo-Nazi and gang tattoos hang in the gang unit office at the police station in Buena Park, Calif., Feb. 24, 2007. The white supremacist gang Public Enemy No. 1 began two decades ago as a group of teenage punk rock fans from upper-middle class bedroom communities in Orange County. Now, it\u2019s spreading to other Western states and gaining power as federal authorities weaken the Aryan Brotherhood and other established white supremacist gangs with racketeering charges and other crackdowns. (AP Photo/Ann Johansson)The FBI report clearly established links between the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican cartels.\u201cThe\u00a0publicly\u00a0available documents illustrate that the Aryan Brotherhood has\u00a0aggressively\u00a0pursued alliances with larger and more powerful crime organizations throughout its history,\u201d Breitbart Texas previously reported. \u201cThey have smuggled, trafficked, and killed on behalf of groups of all shapes, sizes, and\u00a0ethnicities in order to turn a profit. They are hired guns (or fists, or knives, or prison shanks, depending on the situation).\u201dEarlier that month, the Texas Governor Rick Perry appeared on Fox News and discussed the possible connection between Aryan Brotherhood members\u2019 possible involvement in the assassination of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife. He noted that the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican cartels have an established presence in the U.S. and that it would be foolish to dismiss the possibility of their involvement in the case.In January 2016, Breitbart Texas reported on the sentencing of the final two of 34 Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang members for their involvement in a methamphetamine distribution network. The article reported:The [Department of Justice] press release did not indicate specifically which cartel the ABT\u2019s meth supplier was affiliated with. Most of the major Mexican drug cartels are involved in meth production and distribution to different extents. However, Los Zetas and the Gulf cartel tend to have the broadest amount of influence in Texas. The ABT is a white supremacist gang which would normally never consider consorting with Latinos under any circumstances. When it comes to business\u2014and particularly drug trafficking\u2014the ABT and other race-based criminal groups will make interracial alliances if it means bigger profits.All 34 of the gang\u2019s leaders and members were convicted and sentenced to prison.Breitbart Texas reported in April 2015 about the connection between the Aryan Brotherhood and the Gulf Cartel:A series of federal court records that\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u00a0has researched\u00a0to point to a counter-intuitive but close working relation between the Aryan Brotherhood and the Gulf Cartel with the street gang profiting from drug distribution and carrying out contract muscle work for the cartel.Information about the tip leading to Matthew\u2019s arrest is being evaluated to determine if a Crime Stoppers reward will be paid, the DPS reported.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

While Wilkison\u2019s number was four higher than this total because of a local police department\u2019s paperwork tardiness, Politifact determined that Texas does in fact lead the nation in the number of officer deaths.Wilkison\u2019s interview with the\u00a0Texas Standard\u00a0occurred after the July ambush of Dallas police\u00a0officers at a Black Lives Matter protest. Wilkison was asked whether there was a \u201cheightened sense of fear since Dallas.\u201dBreitbart Texas provided coverage\u00a0of the tragic shootings and the aftermath when suspect Micah X. Johnson killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas. Johnson was killed after officers used a robot to set off a bomb near him. Johnson, a former New Black Panther Party member, said he \u201cwanted to kill white people especially white officers.\u201dThe Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP) lists Texas as having 1,866 deaths caused by 27 categories of causes of death, 1096 of those were caused by gunfire, 59 were assaults, 75 were vehicular assaults, 48 were vehicular pursuits, and 170 were automobile accidents. The deaths include those dating back as far as 1837. California, New York, Illinois, and Florida had 1,569, 1,568, 1,070, and 757, respectively reported Politifact.On Tuesday at a Texas Senate Criminal Justice Committee hearing, a Democrat state representative who was allowed to sit in on the hearing responded to the number of downed Texas peace officers saying, \u201cTexas is only second to the state of California in officer killings.\u201d Texas State Representative Borris Miles (D-Houston) is the Democratic nominee for a state senate seat and is unopposed in the upcoming general election.Rep. Miles addressed the senators and the invited witnesses and others gathered there saying, \u201cMr. Wilkison, you stated that Texas has the largest killing of police officers. While I think it is only fair, respectful, that you tell the other side of that story. That Texas is only second to the state of California in officer killings. Only second to California.\u201d Miles then cited what he said were statistics from 2005 saying that there were 112 killings in the state of Texas by police officers that year. Miles said he has introduced three bills over the last eight years that have been opposed by peace officers. He said the bills involved subpoena powers, penalties against officers who use excessive force, and a bill dealing with the \u201cmental state\u201d of police officers. He said his bills were set for hearings but there was never any action on them.Ray Hunt, president of the Houston Police Officers Union (HPOU) was at the hearing along with other law enforcement leaders, including CLEAT executive director Charley Wilkison and Steve McCraw, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). When asked about the comments made by Rep. Miles, Hunt told Breitbart Texas on Wednesday, \u201cI think it is an outrage to compare someone armed and committing a crime, with a peace officer who is enforcing the law and someone is running at them with a gun.\u201dAs to the statement that officers have died in automobile accidents, the HPOU president said, \u201cIt is just ignorant to not know the difference between a Code 1 emergency, and the effect on the police department and their families.\u201dSenator Juan \u201cChuy\u201d Hinojosa (D-McAllen) seemed to try to make a distinction by speaking about the difference in the number of police vehicle wrecks versus gun violence committed against police officers. The CLEAT executive director told Breitbart Texas, \u201cThe officers that died were not doing less, were not giving less, and their families have not lost less if they were changing a tire for someone and were killed when in service to the community.\u201d He added, \u201cThe whole process of denigrating the loss of lives of officers is not new, but it is more pronounced now.\u201dOn Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice meet to hear invited and public testimony on several interim charges. Their\u00a0official tasks\u00a0as stated in the Senate Notice of Public Hearing was to: \u201creview law enforcement efforts to engage community leaders and increase their involvement in communities. Assess dangers to law enforcement officers and the collection and distribution of threat assessment data. Make recommendations to reduce the number of injuries and deaths to or by law enforcement officers.\u201dBreitbart Texas was at the Waller County, Texas, jail in August 2015 for a\u00a0Sandra Bland protest when a\u00a0group of armed members of the New Black Panther Party marched chanting \u201cThe revolution is on\u2026 Off the pigs,\u201d and\u00a0\u201cOink Oink\u2026 Bang Bang!\u201dLess than two weeks later, 30 miles down the road,\u00a0Deputy Darren Goforth was murdered in cold blood at a gas station. Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0the deputy\u00a0was approached from behind as he walked out of the convenience store in northwest Harris County. He was in uniform at the time of the attack. The deputy was shot 15 times from behind. Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman, and the indictment against the black defendant who is suspected of killing him, stated that Deputy Goforth was executed just because he was a cop.Although law enforcement officers have been criticized for police shootings, Breitbart News reported\u00a0\u201cthere\u2019s a huge and growing body of statistical and witness evidence\u00a0that police forces are\u00a0less likely to shoot blacks than whites when enforcing the law amid disproportionate\u00a0and growing criminal violence in African-American communities.\u201dLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

He was booked into\u00a0Lew Sterrett Jail. Although Ruiz\u00a0had no prior criminal record, his bail was set at a total of $200,000 for both charges.Smith said a former student called a DPD detective on October 3. She claimed Ruiz sexually assaulted her eight years ago when she was seven years old and a first grade student in his class.WFAA reported\u00a0that the\u00a0purported victim, now age 16, told the detective\u00a0she was in class when Ruiz called her over one day while other students were outside at recess.\u201cMr. Ruiz had called her over and told her to reach inside his pocket because there was a bunny in there,\u201d read\u00a0the arrest warrant. She said there was a hole in Ruiz\u2019s pocket. When she reached in, she felt his genitals. Two years later, she realized what had happened. The girl told police, she did not tell her mother what happened previously because she was afraid but eventually overcame her fears, the court documents stated. Authorities charged\u00a0Ruiz with continuous sexual abuse of a young child.Assistant Police Chief Smith said,\u00a0through additional investigation, a second victim came forward with similar accusations about Ruiz. He\u00a0was charged with indecency with a child by contact.\u201cCurrently, there are possible additional victims that have come forward who have been scheduled for interviews,\u201d said Smith on Wednesday.\u00a0She encouraged parents to discuss \u201cthese situations with their kids, listen to their children because children will give them information, and if they have anything that is concerning to them, please contact the police department.\u201dKramer Elementary parents were shocked to learn about Ruiz at afternoon pickup. Pete Peabody, whose first and second grade children attend Kramer, told WFAA: \u201cA lot of these parents chose to send their kids here because of the quality of the environment.\u201d Another father, Bruce Kaye, met Ruiz when his students attended Kramer. He said: \u201cI\u2019m a criminal defense attorney and I didn\u2019t get any type of \u2018creepy meter\u2019 vibe or anything like that. (Ruiz) has been here a long time and, at the same time, you have to take everything this child has said very seriously because these are very, very serious allegations.\u201dDallas ISD spokeswoman Robyn Harris described the matter as \u201cvery serious.\u201d She said in a statement:\u00a0\u201cWhile we are unable to comment on this personnel issue involving a teacher, we can share that the individual has been placed on administrative leave. We will continue to cooperate with authorities, and remain committed to providing a safe instructional environment for our students each day.\u201dThis situation\u00a0comes as the state\u00a0grapples with a record 222 cases of improper relationships between teachers and students opened in the 2015-16 school year. Last year marked the eighth consecutive year these cases\u00a0increased, an 80 percent jump\u00a0in reported incidences compared to the 2008-09 school year. Then, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) opened 123. In their 2018-19 budget, the agency asked\u00a0state lawmakers for nearly\u00a0$400,000 to cover three investigative unit new hires to better combat the problem.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Assistant Chief Christina Smith, Dallas Independent School District, Dallas Police Department, Educator, Inappropriate Educator Relationships, Jorge Ruiz, Kramer Elementary School, Teacher-Student Sexual MisconductComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Breitbart Texas ha reportado sobre varios enfrentamientos armados, secuestros, y otros cr\u00edmenes que esparcieron el terror en la ciudad.

Information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Reynosa government revealed that the three former city employees had binders and file cabinets that they were loading into an SUV. The files included information about city checking accounts and other documents from the former government auditor\u2019s office.Law enforcement sources in Tamaulipas consulted by Breitbart Texas revealed that the theft appears to be an effort to hide the embezzling of funds by former city officials.The theft of files and accounting documents comes just days after the swearing in of Maki Ortiz Dominguez from the Partido Accion Nacional party (PAN) who replaced Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Elias from the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI).\u00a0 In response to the theft, Ortiz Dominguez has ordered an extensive investigation to track down any missing documents from the previous administration. During Elias\u2019 term, the Gulf Cartel was able to operate with almost complete impunity in Reynosa. Breitbart Texas has reported on the various gun battles, kidnappings, and other crimes that spread terror throughout the city. The former mayor\u2019s office was also accused by local residents of downplaying or ignoring the out-of-control violence that plagued the city. Ortiz Dominguez won her bid for mayor this summer when candidates from the PAN saw a landslide victory against many of the PRI. As Breitbart Texas has previously reported, the PRI has a long history of corruption and ties to Mexican drug cartels including the Gulf, Los Zetas, Beltran Leyva and the Juarez Cartels. Two former governors of Tamaulipas, Eugenio Hernandez and Tomas Yarrington, are currently considered fugitives by the U.S. Department of Justice. In a similar fashion, Breitbart Texas has also reported how a former mayor of the border city of Matamoros, Erick Silva from the PRI, is also considered a fugitive by the DOJ on money laundering charges. Silva has denied the fact that he has a criminal case against him in the U.S. and has called it a political maneuver.Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

The letter, which the TEA received October 3, was in response to a recent Houston Chronicle\u00a0investigation\u00a0that\u00a0alleged school districts which provide specialized education services to more than 8.5 percent of students get penalized.Breitbart Texas obtained a copy of the letter written by Sue Swenson, Acting Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Education Department Acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSER), to Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath. She stated: \u201cIt appears that the State\u2019s approach to monitoring local educational agency compliance under the PBMAS Indicator 10 may be resulting in districts\u2019 failure to identify and evaluate all students suspected of having a disability and who need special education.\u201d\u201cBased\u00a0on TEA\u2019s response,\u201d Swenson wrote, these federal agencies \u201cwill determine whether additional monitoring activities or other administrative enforcement or corrective actions are necessary.\u201dThe letter cited the Houston newspaper findings that,\u00a0in 2004, nearly 12 percent of Texas students received some form of special education services including tutoring, therapy, and counseling but this figure was down to 8.5 percent by 2015. The publication\u00a0stated the national average hovers around 13 percent and that Texas is the only state to set a target for special education enrollment.According to the Houston Chronicle, the\u00a0TEA quietly implemented an \u201carbitrary\u201d 8.5 percent target\u00a0without consulting the Texas Legislature, State Board of Education, federal government, or any\u00a0research. The report asserted the\u00a0TEA required some school districts that served more than this percentage of students to create \u201cCorrective Action Plans\u201d and schools responded by making special education much harder to access.Also, the publication\u00a0reported the TEA\u00a0denied they prevented disabled students from receiving services and said the 8.5 percent enrollment guideline was not a cap or a target but an \u201cindicator\u201d of performance by school districts.In the letter, Swenson referenced a 2014 conversation between Gene Lenz, Director of TEA\u2019s Division of Federal and State Education Policy, regarding the use of the 8.5 percent \u201cmonitoring standard\u201d in PBMAS Indicator 10.Swenson wrote:\u201cMr. Lenz explained that this indicator was established to address the State\u2019s concern that some districts were inappropriately over identifying students as students with disabilities. He further explained that an elevated PL [Performance Level] was not necessarily indicative of a district noncompliance, but that if a district exceeded the 8.5 percent monitoring standard, the State examined the district\u2019s policies, procedures, and practices more closely to ensure that students were not being inappropriately identified as students with disabilities. If noncompliance was identified through this monitoring process, the district was required to correct the non-compliance.\u201dSwenson commented that Lenz assured OSER staffers that Texas monitors to ensure districts carry out their \u201cChild Find\u201d responsibilities to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities who are in need of special education and related services statewide.Child Find is\u00a0a federal mandate under the\u00a0Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\u00a0(IDEA). It requires all school districts to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities, regardless of the severity of a disability. The mandate applies to all children from birth through age 21 and includes youngsters\u00a0who attend public and private schools, as well as those\u00a0considered highly mobile, illegal immigrants, and who are wards of the state, according to Wrights Law.The letter gives the TEA 30 days to respond to \u201callegations\u201d raised by the\u00a0Houston Chronicle\u2019\u00a0regarding the agency\u2019s special education practices.

Thousands of children were left vulnerable during those decisive hours. Over 14,000 children were left unchecked in those critical hours after a report of neglect or abuse in mid-September, reported the\u00a0Austin American Statesman.\u00a0It was reported that almost 2,000 of these cases were urgent or emergency situations.The\u00a0Texas Tribune\u00a0reported that for each day in the last six months, almost a 1,000 \u201chighest priority\u201d children were not checked. Children have been placed in this category by the agency because of the immediate risk of physical and sexual abuse.\u201cGovernor Abbott and Commissioner Whitman have both clearly stated that the protection of children from abuse is a top priority. The data indicates CPS is falling short of that goal and we absolutely have to get better. These kids have to be seen,\u201d said Patrick Crimmins, media relations manager for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (TDFPS).In April of this year,\u00a0Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed a former chief of the Texas Rangers as new Commissioner of the embattled agency. TDFPS (also referred to as \u201cCPS\u201d) is the agency responsible for protecting abused and neglected children in the state, among other responsibilities.Breitbart Texas has reported about the abuses, problems, and overreach in the agency, particularly among CPS caseworkers. There have been horrific abuses of children who are in the state\u2019s foster care system.The Texas Governor said at that time of the new appointment, \u201cThe status quo at CPS is unacceptable. Our children are too important to suffer through the challenges they\u2019ve faced. I\u2019ve insisted on overhauling a broken system.\u201d\u00a0Abbott added, \u201cI applaud the leadership changes that will provide a new direction and focus that puts protecting children first.\u201d\u00a0The Governor appointed Henry \u201cHank\u201d Whitman as the DFPS commissioner.In April 2014, the advisory council at the department\u00a0approved new agency rules\u00a0after children died while in CPS foster care, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Two-year-old Alexandria Hill and 11-month-old Orien Hamilton both died of blunt-force head injuries sustained by the hands of foster and kinship caregivers approved by CPS. Children are placed in homes that have been approved by child-placing agencies (CPAs) licensed by the CPS. The department licenses the foster child-placing agencies that recruit, investigate, and train potential foster and kinship parents. They also monitor the placements once these individuals become caregivers.\u00a0The new rules which took effect in September of 2014 only applied to new foster homes.Alex Hill died in July 2013 while in a Milam County foster home run by the Department\u2019s #3 foster care contractor, Texas Mentor. Her foster caregiver, Sherill Small, was charged with capital murder after she\u00a0showed law enforcement officers how she smashed Alex\u2019s head against the floor. Rockdale Police Chief Thomas Harris stated that Small became frustrated after Alex got into food and water before the Smalls woke-up one morning. Small \u201cpunished\u201d Alex by making her stand in a dark room for four hours. The Arlington office of Texas Mentor was placed on probation after 114 infractions were found at 56 foster homes during the two years prior to Alex\u2019s death.Orien Hamilton died in October 2013 when she was in an Austin foster home that had been approved by Lutheran Services of the South, the Department\u2019s top CPA.\u00a0The foster mother\u2019s ex-husband, Jacob Salas, pinned Orien\u2019s head to the floor with his knee. Orien already had broken ribs which had partially healed. Orien had a fractured skull, bleeding of the brain and detached retinas. Salas was\u00a0a prison guard who had a history of violence and abuse.\u00a0The foster mother had been licensed in October and the child died less than two weeks later. Orien\u2019s biological father claimed that he had warned Texas officials that Orien was in danger, as reported by\u00a0the Dallas Morning News.According to CPS statistics, there was an alarming increase in the number of deaths of foster children in the agency\u2019s 2013 fiscal year. Eight foster children died in fiscal year 2013; two children died in foster care during fiscal year 2012. Another child died in foster care after the Department\u2019s fiscal year 2014 began in September 2013.In December 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed against CPS. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the lawsuit was filed by a New York advocacy group called Children\u2019s Rights. About 12,000 children who were in long-term care in Texas were included in the class action suit. The advocacy group successfully sought and received a scathing order from a federal district judge.Judge Janis Graham Jack ordered the State of Texas to enact reforms. In so doing, the judge wrote an opinion that said that the long-term foster care system was\u00a0improperly run. She also called it a place \u201cwhere rape, abuse, psychotropic medication and instability are the norm,\u201d as reported by the Dallas Morning News in December 2015. The judge noted that the DFPS and Judge Specia had \u201cthe best intentions\u201d but the system is underfunded. She called the long-term foster care system in the state \u201cbroken.\u201dIn March 2015, Breitbart Texas reported that Texas Governor Greg Abbott directed the DFPS to implement comprehensive reforms. The reforms were aimed at protecting children in the agency\u2019s care. Nine children died under DFPS\u2019 watch during 2014.TDFPS spokesman, Patrick Crimmins told Breitbart Texas on Wednesday, \u201cSpecific to the problem of not seeing children when abuse reports are made, the key to seeing more kids is to get more workers in the field asap. To do that, we have asked for 510 more investigative caseworkers and more CPS Special Investigators.\u201dThe Department\u2019s\u00a0Legislative Appropriations Request (LAR) for fiscal years 2018-2019 includes the following \u201cEXCEPTIONAL ITEM REQUESTS.\u201d As can be seen by the Administrator\u2019s Statement in this LAR, the Department is requesting funding \u201cabove the FY 2018-19 baseline request for six exceptional items totaling $498.1 million general revenue ($534.0 million All Funds).\u201dThe LAR Administrator Statement provides, \u201cNew staffing requests total 1,823.4 FTEs in FY 2018 and 1,943.0 FTEs in FY 2019. This request builds on recent improvements and aligns with the ambitious goals in my 10-point plan. To be successful, this agency must have the resources to fortify and improve the child welfare system and provide young parents with resources to build safe and healthy homes.\u201dThe exceptional items are grouped within eight goals:On September 14, Breitbart Texas reported that CPS announced a new strategic plan to \u201craise the bar\u201d in preventing child abuse in the Lone Star State. The goal is to move from a plan based primarily on investigation-based efforts to an overall effort to strengthen families.\u00a0Officials stated the goal of the plan is to reduce the numbers of incidents of child abuse and neglect. More specifically, the goal is to reduce the numbers of serious injuries and fatalities, according to a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas from CPS officials.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

U.S. Border Patrol Supervisory Agent Marlene Castro described the operation as \u201cdeplorable\u201d in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.\u201cDeplorable\u201d stash house discovered in Hidalgo County, Texas. (Photo: U.S. Border Patrol)The agents worked with state and local law enforcement officials from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Hidalgo County Sheriff\u2019s Office to obtain a search warrant and carry out the raid on the human smuggling warehouse. When the task force arrived at the apartment complex to carry out the raid, they discovered a total of 56 people inside the two small apartments. All admitted to being inside the United States illegally.Five of the people who were discovered inside the apartments, two men and three women, were engaged in the smuggling operation acting as \u201ccaretakers\u201d for those confined in the stash house, Castro wrote in the statement. They were arrested and turned over to authorities for possible prosecution.The 51 illegal immigrants, who were treated as cargo by the human smugglers and crammed into the small apartments, were taken by CBP officials for processing as illegal immigrants. No information was provided as to the gender of those being smuggled or if any minors were involved. The illegal immigrants were reported to be from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the inhuman treatment of these illegal immigrants by their Mexican cartel connected human smugglers. Two weeks ago, the raid of a stash house in Houston yielded 12 illegal immigrants on the city\u2019s north side.Just two weeks prior, 52 foreign nationals were found in another Hidalgo County stash house. Two if the individuals were part of the smuggling operation according to officials, while 50 were illegal immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. The 50 were being held in a house designed for a small family.In April, Breitbart Texas reported on the fate of these human smuggling \u201cpassengers\u201d who often have no idea of what is in store for them as they leave the stash houses in the Texas border region. Brooks County, located about 80 miles north of the Texas/Mexico border is a prime example of the dangers faced by those who turn their lives over to the cartel connected smugglers. Women are frequently raped, men are beaten, people are held hostage for more \u201ctransportation fees,\u201d and immigrants are left to die in the ranch fields surrounding the Falfurrias Border Patrol checkpoint located in the middle of the county.These abuses clearly illustrate the inhumanity faced as a consequence of our nation\u2019s unsecured border.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Once the vehicle was in front of the couple, the gunmen drew .40 caliber pistols and began shooting. The exact number of shots remains uncertain, but authorities revealed that one of the shots struck the victim in the chest. The victim\u2019s boyfriend and his sister rushed her to a local hospital.

Sanchez was indicted earlier this year with 60 other MS-13 gang members. The 33-page indictment is attached below. Five other co-conspirators have already pleaded guilty to charges stemming from this indictment.The deal follows a three-year investigation that led to the indictment of the criminal activities of alleged leaders, members and associates of the MS-13 gang in the commonwealth. Sanchez was identified as a member of the MS-13 Eastside Loco Salvatrucha (ESLS) clique. His role was to \u201cjump in\u201d new members of the gang. He paid street dues to fund the MS-13 activities both in Massachusetts and El Salvador. Under the plea bargain, Sanchez admitted that he and other members of the gang were involved in stabbing a member of a rival gang. The victim of that crime was reported to be a member of the rival 18th Street gang. The incident occurred near Bellingham Square in Chelsea in December 2015, officials stated.In the original indictment, Sanchez was also charged for immigration violations for fraudulent documents. No information as to Sanchez\u2019 nationality or immigration status have been provided by the DOJ at this time. Sanchez pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Dennis Saylor IV. The judge scheduled a sentencing hearing for December 22 where Sanchez could face up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.The MS-13 gang originated out of El Salvador but has engaged in criminal activity across the United States. In September, Breitbart Texas reported on another MS-13 gang member who was charged in a Maryland homicide. In that case, Oscar Delgado-Perez, 28, is accused of brutally stabbing 18-year-old Christian Villagran-Morales to death in what appears to be a gang\u2019s bragging rights.Border Patrol agents in south Texas recently captured three MS-13 members from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador as they re-entered the United States from Mexico. A few days earlier, another MS-13 gang member from Honduras was captured by Border Patrol agents in southern California.Breitbart Texas has been covering this violent transnational gang for several years. In July 2013, four MS-13 gang members were convicted on counts of murder, armed robberies, and firearms offenses. That trial lasted for four weeks. At that time, FBI officials indicated members of the MS-13 gang were active in at least 42 states and had between 6,000 and 10,000 members.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The couple was identified at the time as 28-year-old Valentin Guerrero and 24-year-old Montserrat Reyes Galaviz.As a result of various probes into the case, officers with Coahuila\u2019s Investigative Police identified Luis Leonel Morales Salas as one of the likely gunmen in the case. Information provided to Breitbart Texas by law enforcement sources revealed that the officers tried to arrest Morales Salas during a traffic stop in the city\u2019s south side. Rather than stop, the suspect sped off and began shooting back at law enforcement while the state police officers returned fire. The fleeing gunman ran a local taxi driver off the road, causing him to crash. Authorities were able to catch up with Morales Salas shortly thereafter.During questioning, Morales Salas confessed to his role in the murder in what authorities are calling an \u201cajuste de cuentas\u201d or cartel reckoning. The man is currently facing aggravated kidnapping and murder charges. Breitbart Texas consulted with law enforcement officials who revealed that the two murder victims had ties to organized crime. Montserrat Reyes Galaviz was considered to be an accountant for one faction of the Los Zetas cartel that operates in Coahuila.

As agents moved in, the two men split up and fled. Agents captured one of the men following a brief foot chase, officials stated. The man was reported to be carrying a backpack loaded down with marijuana.The second suspect managed to elude the agents and a search continued to locate the illegal immigrant. The agents were able to locate the backpacks being carried by the two men. They contained nearly 100 pounds of marijuana, estimated to be worth $76,960. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency were contacted to take custody of the 21-year-old Mexican national, Sergio Frias Ladarda, and the drugs. The man will face the possibility of prosecution for drug smuggling.On October 2, Las Cruces agents assigned to the I-10 Border Patrol checkpoint observed a Toyota pick-up truck approaching their position. Agents observed the nervous behavior of\u00a0the driver. A records check on the truck revealed the vehicle was stolen. Agents asked the man to pull forward to a secondary inspection station. The driver decided to ignore the order and fled the checkpoint leading agents on a high-speed chase.Agents contacted the New Mexico State Police who dispatched highway patrol officers to assist the Border Patrol agents in stopping the pursuit. Police successfully deployed tire-deflation devices which brought the Toyota truck to a stop.

Moss\u2019 criminal history revealed convictions for burglary, terroristic threats, and manufacturing/possession of methamphetamine, according to CBP officials.

The girl told investigators that she and a friend were just committing a \u201cprank\u201d and they never intending to hurt anyone. Police in Washington Township, New Jersey arrested two teenagers in connection with two separate threats. The ABC affiliate reported that disturbing photos were posted on Instagram that included the caption, \u201chello we are in the Philadelphia area today.\u201d The post included the ominous warning that children would be kidnapped at 5 p.m.Many of those who are alive today can remember the \u201cKiller Clown,\u201d John Wayne Gacy. The serial murderer and rapist sexually assaulted and killed at least 33 teenage boys and young men in the 1970s. Gacy was reported to have a pleasant personality and entertained children as \u201cPogo the Clown.\u201d He was a Democratic Party precinct chair. He buried most of his victims under his home in Norwood Park, Illinois after he killed them there.

All had prescription pain-killer rates higher than the number of residents living in the state.Medical Director Dr. David Holcombe of the Office of Public Health Region VI in Central Louisiana told WWL-TV New Orleans that the issue was a rapidly-growing problem where big pharmaceutical companies push for more and more prescription pills.\u201cThis has been a disaster almost created and then perpetrated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s driven by pharmaceutical greed, physicians prescribing and patient demand.\u201dHolcombe said that the \u201cepidemic\u201d of prescription pain-killers in these states is not exactly an accident, but rather an orchestrated plan.\u201cWe have been building to this,\u201d Holcombe told WWL.Big pharmaceutical companies not only have great influence over the fast-track pace of prescribing pain-killers, but the industry also has a favorite candidate in the 2016 presidential election.As far back as March, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had already been the biggest benefactor of big pharmaceutical companies, with donations for her candidacy surpassing $500,000 from the industry, according to CNBC.Louisiana specifically, though, has not been a stranger to vast opioid use.In the city of New Orleans, heroin laced with a dangerous opioid drug called fentanyl has become the biggest threat with respect to drugs and addiction, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).The DEA said fentanyl is 50 to 100 times stronger and more dangerous than morphine, along with being cheaper than heroin.Over 65 deaths in New Orleans this year have been tied to opioid abuse, according to previous statements by the city\u2019s coroner who said the rise of the drug has been prevalent since 2014.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Two adults were in the truck with the children and a two-year-old child was sitting on the lap of an adult passenger in the front seat.According to the report by CBS5 in Phoenix, six-year-old Tyrik Jenkins was killed when a Dodge pickup truck driven by 19-year-old German Valdemar Godinez-Godinez hit a Ford Ranger that was making a left turn. The boy was ejected from the bed of the truck and was taken to an area hospital where he later died.The CBS affiliate reported that he is a citizen of Guatemala and considered a flight risk because he has family there. He was reported to have run a red light and allegedly told authorities that he did not see the red traffic light because the visor in his truck was down.Godinez-Godinez was booked for driving under the influence (DUI) and faces one count of manslaughter and five counts of endangerment, according to the report. The judge set a $250,000 cash bond.Officials with the Maricopa County Jail confirmed to Breitbart Texas that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has placed an immigration detainer on the suspect.A court date has been set for the Guatemalan for October 15.Breitbart Texas continues to report about the crimes committed in Texas and other areas by those who are not citizens, are illegal aliens, or illegal aliens that have committed other crimes.In mid-May, Breitbart Texas reported that a previously deported illegal alien killed a teenage girl and critically injured her prom date. Edin Palacios blamed police from who he was fleeing at the time. Palacios, a Guatemalan,\u00a0was observed driving drunk in the early morning hours of May 14th. When officers attempted to stop the pickup truck after it ran over a curb while making a U-turn, the driver pulled over and took off after the police officer got out of his car, Breitbart Texas reported.In April, a Nebraska judge set a $2 million bond for a fugitive illegal alien charged in a hit-and-run DUI homicide case. The DUI is allegedly the fourth for the illegal alien ordered deported in 2012.\u00a0Orline Carrasco-Zelaya (a.k.a Edwin Elvir-Palma), was charged with felony counts of vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of a personal injury accident resulting in a death, and an aggravated DUI for his third offense. The 27-year-old Honduran native is listed as a fugitive illegal alien after being ordered deported in 2012, reported Breitbart Texas and KMTV CBS3.In June, a 29-year-old female was placed on an immigration hold in California after she was charged in connection with the death of a 69-year-old man who was struck by her car and hurled through her windshield. Breitbart News reported that she faced\u00a0felony charges of gross vehicular manslaughter, driving under the influence, hit and run, and a misdemeanor count of driving without a license. The man was hit at 6 a.m. when he was walking on the sidewalk. Esteysi Sanchez Izazaga drove about a mile with the man still in her window. He was hit so hard his leg \u201cdetached from his body and flew through the back window, landing on the truck of the car.\u201d She said she fell asleep and woke-up when shattered glass from her windshield hit her in the face.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Last year, the TEA investigated a\u00a0record-breaking 222 cases. This reflected an 80 percent increase in cases\u00a0compared to the 2008-09 school year when the agency opened 123. In\u00a02009-10, they reported 141 cases; in 2010-11, 152 cases; 2011-12, 156 cases; 2012-13, 163; 2013-14, 179; and 2014-15, 188.The 2014-15 spike was\u00a0so troubling that Lt. Governor Dan Patrick\u00a0charged the Texas Senate Education Committee with the task of examining these improper relationships and assess the role social media played in fostering these incidences, to seek\u00a0policy solutions to present at the 85th Legislature in 2017.Although the proliferation of social media and texting as classroom tools get blamed for\u00a0the increase in teacher-student sexual misconduct cases, the problem may run deeper. Dr. Ernest\u00a0Zarra, III, author of \u201cTeacher-Student Relationships: Crossing into the Emotional, Physical, and Sexual Realms,\u201d\u00a0says\u00a0it\u00a0reflects a breakdown in society\u2019s moral fiber exacerbated by blurred boundaries between adults and students in an Internet age where underlying psychological factors often influence why some\u00a0adults form inappropriate bonds with students.The\u00a0TEA submitted\u00a0its 2018-19 legislative appropriations in August. They asked for $391,134 and three full-time employees (FTE), two investigators and one administrator. They\u00a0explained:\u00a0\u201cFor the past decade, there has been a steady increase in the number of inappropriate educator-student relationships reported to the Agency. When these cases are reported, the Agency investigates them as quickly and as efficiently as possible to ensure the safety of Texas children. In cases where inappropriate behavior is discovered, the Agency conducts an investigation to determine an appropriate sanction (if any) against the educator\u2019s certification, which may include revocation. As the caseload has increased, the number of investigators has remained the same over the past several years. This request will allow for the more efficient and timely investigation of these types of cases. It should be noted, however, that the Agency does not currently have authority to investigate or sanction non-certified educators, an issue that is worthy of consideration during the upcoming Legislative Session.\u201dTEA Director of Educator Investigations Doug Phillips\u00a0told the Texas Tribune:\u00a0\u201cNeedless to say, if we had two more investigators, we would be able to spread those cases out more and we would be able to get to those cases a little faster.\u201d He said: \u201cI have every reason to believe that that case number will continue to increase.\u201dBreitbart Texas reported Phillips voiced\u00a0concerns that many cases go\u00a0unreported or schools strike secret deals with offending educators,\u00a0squelching information. He told the Tribune\u00a0some superintendents handle the matter by not renewing a questionable teacher or coach\u2019s contract.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to non-renew a person or to let them just leave on their own than it is to terminate them for districts,\u201d Phillips said, noting legal costs mount when employees fight contract terminations.He has also pointed out the difficulties in prosecuting these cases\u00a0because of the way the law is written. Breitbart Texas reported:\u201cTexas Penal Code 21.12 considers improper relationships a second degree felony that can result in 2-20 years in prison. Phillips pointed out not all improper relationship cases are considered crimes. For example, a teacher-student sexual relationship where the student attends a different school district than where the teacher is employed, when sexual contact cannot be proven, and if\u00a0there is no sexual contact but where the adult initiates the solicitation of a romantic relationship (Texas Administrative Code 249.3).\u201dTEA investigations can end with the State Board of Educator Certification (SBEC) issuing\u00a0a punishment as light as a reprimand to\u00a0suspension, license surrender/revocation, or prison. Cases are sometimes closed because of lack of proof. Although the SBEC can sanction educators for improper relationships with students, those who avoid conviction can, theoretically, keep their teacher certifications.Buck Gilcrease, chair of\u00a0the Texas Association of School Administrators (TASA) and a Houston-area school district superintendent, asserted\u00a0the laws necessary to crack down on inappropriate relationships are \u201calready on the books,\u201d according to the Texas Tribune.\u201cI think most school districts and most employers of people where this happens have offered sufficient training,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cI personally feel it comes down to terrible, immoral actions done by those people.\u201dLast year,\u00a0TEA spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe\u00a0told Breitbart Texas, \u201cThe vast majority of our teachers are working in an ethical and moral manner each and every day.\u201d She stated, \u201cParents expect their children to be safe when they are at school. Maintaining a safe environment is one of our highest priorities.\u201dFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, Inappropriate Educator Relationships, Teacher-Student Sexual Misconduct, Texas Education AgencyComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Texas Supreme Court Justice John Devine disagreed with his fellow justices and wrote that the Court should have heard the case.The lawsuit was brought by Houston taxpayers before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion granting\u00a0same-sex marriage rights in\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges. The taxpayer lawsuit was an attempt to stop cities like Houston from granting employee benefits to same-sex couples who were married in a state that recognized gay marriage when Texas law did not. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and granted a temporary injunction blocking the City\u2019s actions.\u00a0The Obergefell decision was issued prior to the Court of Appeals hearing and was cited by the intermediate appellate court when it overturned the trial court\u2019s injunction.As reported by Breitbart Texas on September 4, Justice Devine issued a dissenting opinion which stated that while the U.S. Supreme Court has declared that same-sex couples may marry, the U.S. Constitution does not necessarily require cities to offer benefits to same-sex spouses of employees. While marriage may be a fundamental right, spousal benefits are not, he reasoned. He wrote that the same constitutional strict scrutiny does not apply to employment benefits.In their motion for rehearing, Petitioner/Plaintiff taxpayers argue that there is no \u201cfundamental right\u201d for married couples to receive taxpayer-funded benefits or subsidies. They urge that the Texas Supreme Court should instruct state courts to narrowly construe the\u00a0Obergefell\u00a0same-sex marriage ruling because the SCOTUS decision has no legal basis in the Constitution. They also argue that the ruling should be narrowly construed because it threatens the religious freedom of those who oppose homosexual behavior.The Petitioners write:[I]t is urgent that this Court step in and instruct the district court to narrowly construe the ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015)\u2014and the urgency has only grown since we filed our brief on the merits. Justice Devine\u2019s dissent, along with recent rulings of federal courts that continue to abuse the judicial power by imposing ideologies that cannot be found anywhere in the Constitution, make it imperative for this Court to grant the petition for review and announce that the 5 courts of this State must construe Obergefell and similar rulings as narrowly as possible.One of the lawyers for the plaintiff taxpayers who also serves as the president of Texas Values, Jonathan Saenz said, \u201cWe urge the Texas Supreme Court to take up this case to bring justice to the Houston taxpayers who were robbed because of Mayor Annise Parker\u2019s illegal political agenda. Allowing Mayor Parker to change state law on taxpayer funded benefits by an executive order and bypass the Texas Legislature is embarrassing and unlawful. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Obergefell ruling was about requiring access to a same-sex marriage license. To now use that ruling to force private taxpayers to pay for same-sex benefits of government employees is judicial activism to the highest degree.\u201d\u201cWe are asking the Texas Supreme Court to bring justice to taxpayers whose dollars were sacrificed on Mayor Parker\u2019s altar of political correctness,\u201d\u00a0attorney and former Harris County Republican Party chairman Jared Woodfill told Breitbart Texas.\u00a0Woodfill explained, \u201cMayor Parker issued an executive order to go around the Texas Legislature and this violates the religious liberties of those who oppose same-sex marriage. It also tramples on the Tenth Amendment rights afforded to the Texas legislature and tramples on\u00a0the Legislature\u2019s power of the purse.\u201dLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

The most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pink eye). Statewide, the\u00a0DSHS recommends\u00a0testing for anyone with three Zika symptoms and all pregnant women who traveled to areas\u00a0with active Zika transmission, even if\u00a0they show no signs of the virus.Although there are no reports of\u00a0locally-spread Zika in Texas, these Rio Grand Valley counties at the state\u2019s southernmost tip\u00a0remain\u00a0at higher risk for the virus\u2019\u00a0transmission. This is based on the area\u2019s\u00a0experiences with local transmission of Dengue fever, a virus like Zika. Both are spread by the\u00a0Aedes aegypti mosquito, native to Texas. Cases of Dengue are most commonly reported from August through December.Public health\u00a0officials have long feared the Rio Grande Valley could be one of the first places hit by Zika in Texas. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine in Houston, told NBC DFW the alert is a good start, but more south Texas counties may need to be added.\u00a0\u201cI might consider expanding the area where we are going to do expanded Zika testing to Harris County as well as possibly Bexar County as well,\u201d\u00a0he said.In May, Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0on the threat Zika poses to the\u00a0Texas-Mexico border and Gulf Coast regions. The State remains on\u00a0high alert for the virus since August when the Miami outbreak occurred. Officials continue\u00a0to roll out\u00a0preparations to lessen Zika\u2019s impact should it spread via\u00a0local mosquitoes.\u00a0In February, Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0the DSHS\u00a0feared\u00a0such a \u201ctransmission cycle\u201d could happen in the Lone Star State.As of October 3, Texas reported 218 Zika cases, all associated with travel Zika-infected regions. This count includes 13 pregnant women, two infants infected before birth, and two people who contracted the virus through sexual contact from partners infected outside the United States.The State\u00a0accounted for 75 women in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Zika Pregnancy Registry. This includes the aforementioned 13 pregnant women plus pregnant women and newborns who test Zika positive\u00a0but are not listed as Zika cases because they have no symptoms or because the infection can not clearly be identified as Zika.DSHS continues to advise\u00a0pregnant women to delay travel to areas where Zika\u00a0is actively spreading. The department also cautions against unprotected sexual contact with partners who recently traveled to active Zika regions since the virus spreads through sexual transmission.People can take simple precautions to prevent the mosquito bites, in general, and forestall the possible spread of Zika\u2013apply an EPA-approved insect repellent, wear long pants and shirts that cover exposed skin, use air conditioning indoors, keep\u00a0window and door screens in good condition, and remove standing water from around the home.Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.Breitbart Texas, CDC, Dengue Fever, Dr. John Hellerstedt, Dr. Peter J.

The amount of the exemption may not exceed 20 percent and may not be less than $5,000 unless the Texas Legislature prescribes other monetary restrictions.\u00a0An eligible adult is entitled to receive other applicable exemptions provided by law, such as the homestead exemption with statewide application pertaining to ad valorem taxation for general elementary and secondary public school purposes, the plaintiffs argue.The Legislature codified the local option homestead exemption in the\u00a0Texas Tax Code.The lawsuit states that a joint resolution adopted by the 84th Legislature in 2015 (S.J.R. 1) amended the Texas Tax Code\u00a0and provides that the \u201cgoverning body of a school district, municipality, or county that adopted an exemption under Subsection (n) for the 2014 tax year may not reduce the amount of or repeal the exemption.\u201d The provision expires December 31, 2019. It became effective on January 1, 2015.The plaintiff taxpayers argue that \u201cIn adopting S.B. 1, the Legislature intended to prevent school districts, municipalities, and counties from reducing the amount of or repealing local option homestead exemptions that they had adopted for the 2014 tax year for use in subsequent years.\u201dMoreover, they urge the legislative intent as evidenced in the Bill Analysis of S.B. 1 states that\u00a0\u201c[a]ny local taxing units that currently offer the optional homestead exemption must maintain the current exemptions offered for 10 years.\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0bill would prohibit a school district, municipality, or county that has adopted an optional percentage homestead exemption for the 2014 tax year under Section 11.13(n) Tax Code from reducing or repealing the exemption for a period extending through the end of tax year 2019.\u201dThis legislative intent was confirmed in a letter from Senator Jane Nelson (R-Flower Mound). Sen. Nelson serves as the Chair of the Senate Finance Committee.On March 17, 2016, the Office of the Attorney General of Texas issued a formal opinion (KP-0072) that held that \u201cany repeal of or reduction in the amount of a local option homestead exemption by a school district, municipality, or county in 2015 would have no effect under subsection 11.13(n-1)\u2019s express terms.\u201dTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton has intervened in the lawsuit against Kilgore ISD saying\u00a0that the district violated state law and the Texas Constitution when it repealed the local option homestead exemption. Paxton filed a similar intervention against the White Deer Independent School District on September 15.In a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas, AG Paxton said,\u00a0\u201cLocal governments cannot be allowed to simply ignore laws that they do not like. This is a blatant attempt by a school district to take away from Texas homeowners, without their vote or consent, what rightfully belongs to them \u2013 their own money. I am confident that the local taxpayers and the State will prevail in this lawsuit and the suits to come.\u201dUpon the filing of the lawsuit, SB 1 author Senator Jane Nelson said: \u201cSB 1 clearly stated that the tax relief approved last session was over and above any local option homestead exemption. Implementation of the law needs to be uniformly enforced across the state.\u201dTexas State Senator Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston) told Breitbart Texas, \u201cThe 22 ISDs that cancelled their optional homestead exemption are denying their own taxpayers the homestead exemption approved by voters and the Legislature. They are totally wrong and the courts will order them to reverse their illegal action.\u201d Bettencourt served as the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector prior to becoming a state senator.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

At least one of the robbers displayed a firearm, according to Montgomery County Police Reporter\u2019s Scott Engle. One of Turner\u2019s employees responded by pulling an AK-47 semi-automatic rifle from behind the counter. The gunman fired at the store employees and a firefight ensued. At least three employees were said to have fired weapons at the robbery suspects.The suspect who began shooting was struck and killed in the gun fight. The other three suspects escaped\u00a0in a white Dodge Charger. Police found the Charger not far from the scene of the robbery. The suspects in the failed robbery attempt had abandoned the car and remain at large, Engle reported.Police have not yet released the identity of the deceased suspect.The attempted robbery took place on Monday afternoon at about 12:30 p.m.Turner\u2019s attorney, E. Tay Bond, spoke with the Conroe Courier\u2019s Catherine Dominguez. \u201cYou always have a right to defend yourself, especially when the robber shoots at you.\u201d Bond confirmed that Turner keeps an AK-47 in the store for defensive purposes.The AK-47 rifle is manufactured in both automatic and semi-automatic models. In a semi-automatic weapon you must pull the trigger each time you want to fire. An automatic weapon will fire as long as you hold the trigger, until you run out of ammunition.Conroe Police Department\u2019s Lt.

At that time, Dominguez reported, one of the employees grabbed a shotgun and the would-be robbers said, \u201cThey\u2019ve got guns. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201dThe store employees were\u00a0able to successfully stop the robbery and protect the lives of other\u00a0employees and customers who were threatened by the armed gunmen.A search for the suspects, which included support from a Drug Enforcement Agency helicopter, was not successful and the police manhunt continues.

Once outside, though, Wood said a security guard told him he would have to agree never to bring the state flag with him to another Ole Miss game or run the risk of being arrested. When Wood asked if he would truly be arrested for carrying the state\u2019s flag, prompting the officer to spin him around and arrest him on the spot, taking him off to the local jail.Although Wood\u2019s flag was slightly larger than the permitted size, he said the flag issue has never been a problem in the past six years he has been attending Ole Miss football games.\u201cThis was never a problem until Ole Miss stopped playing \u2018Dixie,\u2019\u201d Woods told Breitbart Texas.The University of Mississippi announced back in August that it was bending to politically correct standards and would cease to play \u201cDixie,\u201d an iconic song for Ole Miss fans, in order to be more \u201cinclusive,\u201d Fox News reported at the time.Wood said the flag is being targeted by security at Ole Miss games, telling Breitbart Texas that other students had their stickers with the Mississippi state flag on them removed before entering the game.This is not the first time Ole Miss fans carrying Mississippi pride items have been asked to put their flags and banners away.Breitbart Texas reported last month how university security confiscated a number of flags and signs which read \u201cLet the band play \u2018Dixie.\u2019\u201dOne game attendee who had his sign and flag taken, Mike Espildora, took to his Instagram account, writing \u201cOle Miss did a great job displaying their pride and was wrongfully and violently shutdown, the fight isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d referring to the broader assault on the state flag by political correctness on college campuses.A spokesman with the Our State Flag Foundation told Breitbart Texas that it seemed security was specifically targeting Ole Miss fans who support the state flag.\u201cThe University officially says they are targeting because of the \u2018size of the banners, not because they are state flags\u2019,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThis is highly questionable though when you watch the videos, also because they allow big inflatable sharks, big foam fingers and retractable scroll signs sold in the stadium which are much larger than the Dixie and small state flags that were confiscated and targeted.\u201dMississippi State University and the\u00a0Mississippi University for Women have already removed the state flag from their campuses, as a politically correct-charged movement claims the banner promotes a racist ideology dating back to the Confederacy.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Cristo Rey, New Mexico, were searching for a group of illegal immigrants who had just crossed the border near Puerto de Anapra, Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey is located in the extreme southeastern tip of the state and a few miles west of El Paso, Texas.Agents requested air support from a helicopter assigned to the El Paso Branch of Air and Marine Operations (AMO), according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials by Breitbart Texas Monday afternoon. The aircrew responded and used its \u201cforward looking infrared camera\u201d (FLIR) to locate the immigrants who were hiding in the darkness of a near moonless night.The aircrew guided agents to the location of the immigrants. One of the illegal aliens who had been hiding in the brush suddenly ran toward one of the agents. As the agent grabbed the man and attempted to take him into custody, a fight broke out. As the agent was wrestling with the man, both were \u201churtled over a six-foot ledge,\u201d officials stated. The agent\u2019s head struck a rock and he was temporarily disabled. The suspect fled the scene.The aircrew from the AMO helicopter used its spotlight follow the suspect and guide other agents to his location. A \u201cgovernment issued electronic control device\u201d was eventually used to disable the man. He was taken into custody without further incident.Agents from the El Paso Sector Horse Patrol Unit, with the help of the aircrew, searched, found, and captured the remaining illegal immigrants.The agent who was injured in the fall from the ledge was treated at the scene and then transported via helicopter air ambulance to the Las Palmas Medical Center in El Paso.The illegal alien who allegedly assaulted the Border Patrol agent was taken into custody and turned over to the FBI. He faces the possibility of prosecution on a felony charge of Assault on a Federal Officer. It is expected he will be processed for Expedited Removal following his prosecution by the Department of Justice.The injured agent was treated released by the hospital. No information was available on the nationality of this suspect or the others traveling with him.There has been a significant increase in assaults against Border Patrol agents by illegal aliens during FY 2016, according to CBP officials. As of the end of August, the latest numbers available, 404 Border Patrol agents have been assaulted. This compares to 360 agents who were assaulted in the same period of FY 2015. That is an increase of 12 percent.

The shopping center was less than 150 meters from the Reynosa City Hall and less than 300 yards from the Texas border.The Mexican Marines requested air support and additional troops to ensure that the man they had spotted was Comandante Toro. Cartel lookouts noticed the activity by military personnel and sounded the alarm, setting off an escape operation by Gulf Cartel forces. A military helicopter chased and shot at a black Nissan Pathfinder that tried to flee the area at a high rate of speed. The shots from the helicopter disabled the truck forcing the men inside to run out into the nearby shops and buildings in an effort to blend in with the crowd. The gunmen running into the market caused panic among the local shoppers.Cartel lookouts received orders to hide and blend among the shoppers while military personnel set up a perimeter around the downtown area and began a search for the gunman they believed to be Toro. Meanwhile, the real Toro managed to sneak out to safety. Breitbart Texas has spoken with law enforcement officials who revealed that some military deserters make up part of Toro\u2019s personal security detail. The former personnel are familiar with military tactics, apparently helping Toro avoid capture.In an effort to confuse military forces, cartel members began to stack tires that were then set on fire. Cartel trucks drove around the city distributing tires while gunmen stole various vehicles from unsuspecting motorists. The vehicles were used to park along main roads and set on fire to create additional roadblocks.In the afternoon, citizen journalists began to speak about the capture and eventual release of a cartel commander named \u201cBeto\u201d or \u201cBetito\u201d who has been described as Toro\u2019s relative.

Felix was charged with attempted murder, discharging a firearm causing great bodily injury and association with a criminal street gang.After Felix was released from on those charges, a detective went to his father\u2019s house looking for his brother three years ago and recognized Felix, who was on parole at the time.In a police report about the event three years ago, the detective said: \u201cI know that John is a member of a criminal street gang and has been involved in multiple shootings. Due to John\u2019s angry and agitated state, and history of violence, I requested dispatch to have an additional unit respond.\u201dAfter allegedly scuffling with the detective, Felix was charged with resisting arrested, but the charge was dropped.That incident, three years ago, happened at the same address where police say John Hernandez Felix lured police on Saturday with a call about a domestic disturbance before gunning down two police officers. One of the officers, Jose Gilbert \u201cGil\u201d Vega, was a 35-year veteran of the Palm Springs Police Department. The other, Lesley\u00a0Zerebny, was a rookie and new mother.

Pollak8 Oct 20160Inside, there was excited talk about the new Tea Party class, about fixing Washington, about finding places to live in high-rent D.C. And there was also talk about women \u2014 that kind of talk.Some of the new members, many of whom had spent the day surrounded by young, attractive, ingratiating, dressed-to-the-nines female would-be staffers, wondered aloud how they were going to avoid the temptations of being surrounded every day by such creatures.The details do not matter: suffice it to say the language used was not that much better than\u00a0the newly-surfaced lewd chat that\u00a0Donald Trump had with Billy Bush on a live mic, eleven long years ago.Not every man talks that way about women. But plenty do \u2014 in the locker room, on the golf course, and on Capitol Hill. I was once taken aback when one\u00a0congressman praised\u00a0my wife\u2019s looks, in rather lurid terms.Some of the same\u00a0Republicans are beating\u00a0a disgraceful retreat from Trump, acting as if they have never heard such language before.Lewd talk is bipartisan. Elections are about choices, and the choice on the Democratic side is not Pope Francis, but the Clintons. Bill not only had oral sex with an intern in the Oval Office, and lied about it, but has faced repeated\u00a0accusations\u00a0of sexual assault. Hillary has done her part by attacking Bill\u2019s accusers, calling them\u00a0\u201cbimbo eruptions.\u201dPerhaps the most glaring case of hypocrisy is that of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\u00a0In his bodybuilding days, Schwarzenegger was notorious for \u2014 and proud of \u2014 his many exploits with women. In his 1977 autobiography, Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder, Schwarzenegger recalled how he had once treated women as \u201csex objects.\u201d (He said his views had changed.) When he ran for governor, he faced questions about a 1977 interview in which he recalled rough sex with a woman at a California gym: \u201cEverybody jumped on her and took her upstairs where we all got together,\u201d he had said.As governor, Schwarzenegger not only cheated on his wife, Kennedy scion Maria Shriver, but impregnated the housekeeper.Yet on Saturday, The Terminator joined the chorus of critics bashing Trump, telling fellow Republicans that it was their \u201cduty\u201d to \u201cchoose your country over your party\u201d when they voted.Sen. John McCain, whose own treatment of women was a topic of concern in the 2008 election \u2014 dating strippers, alleged affairs, rumors that he used the \u201cc-word\u201d towards his wife \u2014 withdrew\u00a0his support for Trump on Saturday. And 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who was accused of leading a \u201cwar on women\u201d and ridiculed for his\u00a0statement about \u201cbinders full of women,\u201d slammed\u00a0the Republican nominee (again) for a statement made long before Romney eagerly sought his endorsement in 2012.Other Republican leaders are demanding\u00a0Trump drop out of the race. The Republican National Committee has\u00a0withdrawn its mailings for Trump. Chuck Todd of NBC News\u00a0reported Saturday that right now,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s every Republican for themselves.\u201dThey are worried that Trump\u2019s 2005 comments \u2014 made when he was a businessman, TV star, and private citizen \u2014 will be the next Todd Akin moment, when Republicans let Democrats saddle them with one odd\u00a0comment about abortion in 2012.\u00a0Then as now, Republicans compounded the damage by treating a media\u00a0controversy as a \u201ccrisis.\u201dIt is worth asking whether this panicked\u00a0mob has the rudimentary\u00a0courage required to stand up to the Islamic State, or Vladimir Putin, if they cannot bear the pressure of a manufactured \u201cOctober surprise.\u201dIf they are willing to lose the country \u2014 for that is what may\u00a0be at stake \u2014 over a decade-old joke, they might deserve to lose.And if Trump wins regardless, look out: he will have done it on his own.Joel B.

The fingerprint reader\u00a0is akin to those found on iphones\u2013which also won\u2019t unlock the phone if the user\u2019s finger is wet.According to The Wall Street Journal, Kloepfer was first motivated to design the smart gun after seeing news of James Holmes\u2019 July 2012 attack on the Aurora movie theater. But Kloepfer admits his smart gun would not have prevented that attack, as Holmes purchased all his guns legally\u2013via background checks\u2013and would, therefore, be the authorized user of a Glock 22 with a fingerprint reader.Kloepfer\u2019s smart gun is called \u201cBiofire\u201d and he expects to have \u201ca live-firing prototype\u201d in a few months. He has already won a grant from the\u00a0Smart Tech Challenges Foundation and the support of Ron Conway, an investor \u201cknown for his early-stage backing of Google, Facebook\u00a0and Airbnb.\u201dBut Kloepfer\u2019s smart gun does not fire if the authorized user\u2019s finger is wet. Moreover, even when it does fire, the cycle from locked to ready to fire takes one and half seconds. One and half seconds is an eternity for an elderly person under duress or a single mom being charged by a gang of invaders in her own home.\u00a0Kloepfer showed the WSJ that if he dries his finger\u2013by rubbing it back and forth on his pants\u2013he is able to get a good read and the gun will unlock. So that\u2019s a couple of seconds drying the finger plus the one and the half seconds it takes to unlock the gun once the fingerprint is read. This is smart gun technology?WSJ asked Kloepfer if the fingerprint reader will work if the authorized user is wearing gloves or his fingers are dirty. The response was that \u201cthe first Biofire model is designed for home users, who don\u2019t often encounter these issues.\u201d Hmmmm. So now we have a smart gun that will not work if fingers are wet and is not designed for the possibly of gloves or dirty hands?The people at the Smart Gun Symposium were still excited about it.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Steve Owen,\u00a0according to the Los Angeles Times.When a residential burglary call came in just after noon on Wednesday, Owen was the first on the scene. A LASD statement recounted what happened next: \u201cIn an active attempt to preserve life and property and establish a containment, Sergeant Owen positioned himself to the rear of the location. The suspect encountered Sergeant Owen, produced a handgun and opened fire, striking Sergeant Owen.\u201dThe suspect, described as a black male adult on active parole, then attempted to commandeer Owen\u2019s patrol vehicle, but was interrupted by a second deputy arriving on scene. A deputy-involved shooting ensued and the suspect rammed Owen\u2019s vehicle head-on into the assisting deputy\u2019s vehicle,\u00a0according to the LASD. The suspect then ran from the scene and entered a residence where two frightened teenagers responded by alerting the Sheriff\u2019s Department.An LASD special weapons team entered the residence in an effort to protect the teens and the suspect fled out the back door. \u201cLess-than-lethal\u201d devices were used to prevent the suspect from re-entering and the teens were rescued. The fleeing suspect breached a wall, but was caught by deputies and taken into custody. He had sustained a gunshot to the upper torso. Investigators are not looking for others suspects as of late Wednesday.\u201cToday, we mourn the loss of a man who made a difference; for his family, his fellow deputies and his community. I want to thank the reporters who are taking the time to describe the numerous acts of kindness, service and mentoring that defined the life of Sergeant Steve Owen,\u201d said Sheriff Jim McDonnell in a Thursday press conference.Owen, 53, was a large man, but \u201cvery polite, sincere and genuine\u201d according to Chief Bobby Denham, cited in the Times. Denham said he was known by the bad guys as fair and willing to talk, but tough on crime. A volunteer football coach, youth mentor, advisor, and\u00a0equestrian,\u00a0in the department\u2019s mounted detail, Owen was \u201cprobably the most well-known law enforcement officer in the Antelope Valley,\u201d said Denham.Cmdr. Mike Parker remarked of Owen\u2019s generosity that if a victim didn\u2019t have food on the table, he would put it there.Owen received the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Medal of Valor, along with other deputies, for his role in cracking a 2013 carjacking and kidnapping case, according to the Times.McDonnell said in a separate statement, \u201cThe tragedy of a deputy sheriff such as Sergeant Steve Owen making the ultimate sacrifice has a massive impact on the whole law enforcement family. We all mourn together and our hearts go out especially to Steve\u2019s immediate family Tania, a detective at Arson/Explosives Detail, his two adult sons Brandon and Chad, a step-daughter Shannon and his mother Millie.\u201dBreitbart California, Law Enforcement, Blue Lives Matter, burglary, killed, Los Angeles, medal of valor, Sheriff's Department, Steve OwenComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak7 Oct 20160Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was widely seen as the winner of the first debate, and could hurt her opponent\u2019s chances if she goads him into a serious\u00a0error or gaffe. But Republican nominee Donald Trump has bounced back in the polls, and is riding the momentum of his running mate\u2019s strong performance in the vice presidential debate. If Trump turns in a solid performance on Sunday, he could sprint to catch Clinton at the finish.The moderators of the town hall-style debate will be Martha Raddatz of ABC News and Anderson Cooper of CNN. Both lean left, and both can be expected to be tougher on Trump than on Clinton.Here are five questions that both Trump and Clinton should expect to face, either from the moderators or \u2014 in some form \u2014 from the participants in the town hall, whose questions will be pre-screened.1. With Hurricane Matthew battering the Atlantic coast, what will you do about climate change? The question makes no scientific sense, because Hurricane Matthew has nothing to do with climate change. In fact,\u00a0until this year,\u00a0no hurricanes had hit the U.S. in more than ten years, confounding the predictions of climate alarmists. But the question will be asked, and is designed to test Trump against the liberal climate orthodoxy. (Clinton\u2019s answer will be the usual boilerplate, coupled with a charge of \u201cdenialism\u201d against Trump).Trump will have to thread the needle carefully. Without denying climate change as a whole, he will have to\u00a0note that shutting down the coal industry, as Clinton wants to do, cannot be the answer. He should also note that he personally visited Louisiana this summer to visit flood victims, while Clinton hobnobbed on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.2. Both of you have high disapproval ratings. How will you be a role model for America\u2019s children? That question, or something like it, will be another veiled attack on Trump, since Clinton is a role model by default for being the first female nominee for president from a major party, no matter how poor a candidate she may be. Expect Clinton to bring out the same attack lines that\u00a0feature in her campaign commercials, and which her running mate pounded at the vice presidential debate.The question gives Trump an opportunity to score points off Clinton for her many scandals. But the best response is\u00a0for Trump\u00a0for to point to his own children\u00a0\u2014 especially his daughter Ivanka \u2014 who are successful, poised, and his best character witnesses.3. Hundreds of thousands may die in Aleppo, the latest in\u00a0a brutal\u00a0civil war. What should we do about Syria? Expect this question to come from Anderson Cooper, who likes to show his foreign policy chops. It is the question neither candidate wants to answer, since the problem cannot really\u00a0be solved short of war with Iran and confrontation with Russia. Clinton has a standard answer, which is to talk about continuing the Obama administration\u2019s fight against ISIS (such as it is). She may try to claim she wanted to do more about Syria as Secretary of State but was overruled.If she does, Trump should not let her off the hook: if she really cared about Syria, she ought to have resigned. As for his own policy, his strongest point is his criticism of Arab countries for doing everything to stoke the fighting and nothing to help the refugees.\u00a0He should pledge to stop that.4. The economy continues to create jobs, and household incomes rose last year. How will you improve on that?\u00a0In the first debate, the moderator painted a rosy picture of Obama\u2019s economic record. Clinton, who proposes to continue Obama\u2019s policies, but with an even greater focus on inequality (if that is even possible), will rattle off her talking points about raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich.Trump, who pushed back in the first debate by noting that the stock market is in a\u00a0bubble and that Clinton has never created a real job in her life, should offer a better\u00a0response this time, with three parts. First, he should talk about the Americans whom he has met on the campaign trail who are suffering in\u00a0the Obama-Clinton economy\u00a0and who are uncertain about the future. Second, he should bring up Obamacare, which has helped make this recovery the slowest since World War II, and which Clinton supports completely.\u00a0And third, he should note that Clinton\u2019s policies \u2014 higher taxes, higher fuel prices, more unskilled illegal aliens, and more needless regulations \u2014 will make the economy even worse.5. I\u2019m a veteran who lost friends in war. How can I trust either of you to be commander-in-chief? At least one question will \u2014 and probably should \u2014 go to a soldier, or a soldier\u2019s family, to present the \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d test. In this case, the question will also allow CNN and ABC to revive the Khizr Khan controversy, which marked the low point for Trump in the general election. Clinton will emphasize her experience in office, however dubious. She may even recycle her running mate\u2019s line that when she took office as Secretary of State, Osama bin Laden was still alive \u2014 to which Trump should answer: yes, and so were Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.In addition to hammering her over Benghazi, and her lies to the bereaved families, Trump should borrow his own running mate\u2019s tactics and remind Clinton\u00a0of the failed Russian \u201creset,\u201d the disaster in Iraq, and the awful Iran deal. He must also make\u00a0a promise: though he may not have served in the military, he will never sleep when there are Americans in danger, and Americans risking their lives to save them.Joel B.

Pollak7 Oct 20160The reason was simple: the people of Colombia felt their leaders had given away too much to the terrorists, denying justice to the victims and creating incentives for future terror.But no one had listened\u00a0to them. The Obama administration, for example, was heavily invested in the peace deal\u00a0as part of its outreach to the Castro regime; Kerry even witnessed the signing of the deal last month.In the U.S., one of\u00a0the few voices\u00a0against the deal was\u00a0Wall Street Journal columnist Mary Anastasia O\u2019Grady, who warned that the deal was \u201cpractically a surrender\u201d:The deal gives the FARC amnesty for its war crimes, which include the recruitment of thousands of child soldiers, massacres of villages, political executions, bombings and kidnappings.Under the agreement, negotiated and signed in Havana, the FARC will also get unelected seats in Congress and special welfare benefits. It will be given dozens of radio stations\u2014so that it can disseminate its propaganda, a privilege no other political party has.The agreement does not require the FARC to pay any financial reparations to its victims, even though the narco-terrorist kingpins have wealth estimated in the billions. Reparations will be paid by law-abiding citizens via sharp tax increases. The FARC says it will not disarm until it\u2019s good and ready to. Meanwhile it will be given weapons and training to enforce the agreement.Colombians were also angry that\u00a0President Juan Manuel Santos had taken the peace agreement to the United Nations before securing the support of the people. He declared to the UN General Assembly last month: \u201cI return to the United Nations today, on the International Day of Peace, to announce with all the strength of my voice and my heart, that the war in Colombia has ended.\u201d (Update: Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.)Yet there are two ways to end a war \u2014 through victory, or surrender. Colombians rejected the latter.O\u2019Grady notes that the Colombian government resorted to a variety of illiberal methods\u00a0to campaign for\u00a0the peace deal, such as promising\u00a0to spend government funds in areas that voted \u201cyes.\u201d The government also warned that voting \u201cno\u201d meant returning to war.Never mind that the last Colombian president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, had pushed FARC back on the battlefield, and that the rebels were weakened as a result. His successor gave those hard-fought gains\u00a0away for nothing.Now the Colombian government will return to the negotiating table \u2014 strengthened, ironically, by the fact that the people have rejected more lenient terms brokered under Havana\u2019s watchful eye. The\u00a0cease-fire with FARC could end on October 31, but the people of Colombia have faced that risk, and decided that the\u00a0price of an illusory peace was even heavier.Theirs was an extraordinarily brave decision \u2014 especially since the regions\u00a0closest to the fighting led the nation in voting \u201cno.\u201dThe Colombian people were able to exercise a choice that the American people never had when it came to the Iran deal. A new Breitbart/Gravis poll released this week confirms that the voters still reject the deal.Americans know\u00a0Iran has no desire for peace, that\u00a0the agreement allows Iran to continue its nuclear weapons program in future years, and that\u00a0the regime will cheat. Americans have consistently rejected the deal \u2014\u00a0along with its grotesque side deals, including ransoms for hostages.The Constitution requires that all treaties be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. So the Obama administration, knowing that the Senate would reject the pathetically weak terms to which it had agreed, called the Iran deal an \u201cexecutive agreement,\u201dThen Congress spoke up with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act,\u00a0demanding the power to reject the deal \u2014 while lowering the threshold for approval\u00a0to an effective one-third of either house, (which is why Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)\u00a0voted against it). That wasn\u2019t good enough for President Barack\u00a0Obama, who took the deal to the UN\u00a0Security Council first, then presented\u00a0Congress with a\u00a0fait accompli and dared it to risk war.In the end, Democrats filibustered, and there was no vote. The first time the American electorate will have a chance to speak out about the Iran deal is in the 2016 presidential election.Both Santos and Obama\u00a0sought to appease terrorism, using the UN\u00a0for\u00a0leverage against their own people. The big\u00a0difference is that Santos submitted his agreement to the voters, recognizing their sovereignty. Obama did not have the decency to do that, despite the clear intent of the Framers of the Constitution that the\u00a0people, through Congress, would decide war and peace.The recent Brexit vote did not quite involve life and death, but saw a similar pattern, where the \u201cremain\u201d campaign\u00a0tried to use\u00a0fears of economic collapse, and international leverage, to quash the voters\u2019 desire for greater sovereignty over Britain\u2019s borders and economic affairs.When treaties and transnational institutions are abused in such anti-democratic fashion, it is no surprise globalization has few defenders left, even though the benefits of (real) peace, and (truly) free trade, are\u00a0elementary.From Brexit, to the Iran deal, to \u201cpeace\u201d with\u00a0FARC, voters have been warned that rejecting the poor terms negotiated by their feckless leaders would mean disaster.The British and Colombian voters have spoken, bravely. Now, finally, Americans will have a turn.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Other big hurricanes in the past tended to roar across Florida in a four-hour period. But the slow-moving Mathew could take 60 hours to reach the Georgia border. The storm is then expected to trash the Mid-Atlantic coast at a leisurely pace, up to at least North Carolina.Total U.S. natural disaster insurance losses hit 16.1 billion in 2015, up from $15.3 billion in 2014, according to\u00a0Munich Re. Last year\u2019s major losses included: $9.6 billion from severe thunderstorms; $3.5 billion from winter storms and cold waves; and $1.9 billion from wildfires, heat waves and drought.The U.S. National Weather Service warned that Hurricane Matthew is not only packing Category 4 winds, but also brings\u00a0up to 25 foot waves, a 9-12 foot storm surge, and 40 inches of rain in some spots. The horrific combination will cause deaths, wash out roads, and cut communication links and cause outages for several weeks.Chuck Watson, disaster modeler with Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia told the Insurance Journal that the record number of emergency evacuations will cause an immense amount of business interruption insurance claims, with at least 1 million people temporarily displaced.The storm path will hit at least twelve U.S. power generators, including two nuclear plants, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nuclear operators NextEra Energy and Duke Energy Corp. have already shut their reactors. Florida Power & Light utility, the largest electric utility in Florida, estimates that up to 1.2 million customers could lose power.Although it is early in the recovery effort, there are already 261 confirmed deaths and 3,200 homes destroyed in\u00a0Hurricane Matthew\u2019s strike on Haiti.

Harris, the favorite, is seen as the scion of an ascendant black Democratic political establishment, and enjoys the support of President Barack Obama and California Gov. Jerry Brown, among others. Sanchez carried the hopes for the growing Latino electorate in California, but has struggled to catch up with Harris\u2019s growing lead in the polls, and there are signs that Latino voters are increasingly backing Harris.Both candidates in the general election are Democrats, thanks to California\u2019s \u201ctop two\u201d or \u201cjungle\u201d primary, in which the top two vote-winners in the primary advance, regardless of party.Sanchez had challenged Harris to four debates, but Harris only agreed to two.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The study shows that most millennials are living in quiet desperation. They face a job market that has left even normally employable new college graduates out of work, or employed at well below their potential as baristas, temps, or in low-level retail jobs.Millennials understand that this situation will have a substantial impact on their lifetime earnings, due to depressed early years and and due to finding themselves\u00a0on a lower income track than those few that landed higher-quality roles straight out of college.According to EIG cofounder and executive director Steve Glickman:The Millennial mindset was dramatically impacted by the harsh economic realities of the Great Recession, which has made them remarkably politically independent, economically pessimistic, and skeptical of traditional institutions. What the establishment doesn\u2019t understand is that in their minds, Millennials did all of the right things \u2013 they worked hard, got their education \u2014 but they incurred huge amounts of debt and the job market they inherited hasn\u2019t rewarded any of these sacrifices. Now they are deeply concerned about their future.Key takeaways about Millennials from the survey:Millennials deeply admire entrepreneurship and believe it is the key to economic success, despite the fact that 90 percent of all new businesses fail within three years. Millennials also believe their biggest impediment to starting their own business is capital:Millennials have a very low level of confidence in American institutions. They are \u201cskeptical of the establishment,\u201d while \u201cremaining fiercely patriotic and supportive of a leading role for the United States in the world\u201d:Millennials are generally comfortable with their own tax burden, but they remain concerned about fairness in the tax system.Millennials tend to prioritize federal spending on education and entitlements:Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics, Economic Innovation Group, entrepeneurial, entrepreneur, Ernst & Young, financial crisis, Great Recession, Millennials, patrioticComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

She made little effort to appeal to the voters, and seemed content to cast aspersions on her opponent. Sanchez, on the other hand, came across as overly eager to appease\u00a0viewers, speaking directly to the camera in a highly animated manner, and\u00a0becoming overly defensive about her record in office.For conservatives watching the race, there was little to enjoy.\u00a0The moderators did a reasonable job of asking pertinent questions about the economy, foreign policy, and issues like immigration. But the candidates stayed firmly within the left-wing paradigm. Neither had anything of interest to say about water issues, for example, with Harris focusing on conservation measures and Sanchez boasting about\u00a0the new innovation that\u00a0is taking place in her\u00a0Southern California stomping ground.The only point of relative interest was when Harris attacked Sanchez for stating\u00a0that up to 20 percent of Muslims support terror. Sanchez, who serves on the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee had been citing global polling data, but Harris and others had cast her remarks as anti-Muslim. At the debate, Sanchez accused Harris of distorting her words \u2014 and that was that.Neither candidate provided any sign\u00a0that she\u00a0would much more than a reliable party-line vote in the Senate.Joel B.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The New York Times reported that Martin, III of Glen Burnie, MD, was arrested, like Edward Snowden, while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA. Martin was supposedly discovered in an investigation of theft and disclosure of a large cache of top-secret NSA spying tools.During a search of Mr. Martin\u2019s residence, agents found paper documents and digital drives that were labeled \u201ctop secret,\u201d including six classified documents that were written in 2014, according to an affidavit filed in conjunction with his arrest.The FBI affidavit said: \u201cDuring the interview, Martin at first denied, and later when confronted with specific documents, admitted he took documents and digital files from his work assignment to his residence and vehicle that he knew were classified.\u201dBut Martin has now been alleged to have also stolen \u201cSensitive Compartmented Information\u201d (SCI), which Breitbart sources referred to as NSA\u2019s \u201ccrown jewels.\u201d These are offensive algorithms used in cyberattacks on foreign military and government systems.Unlike Snowden, who exposed files to demonstrate that the NSA was illegally spying on every American citizen, Martin allegedly operated under the dark net moniker of \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d to hack the NSA Equation Group\u2019s cyber-mining tools. He then offered to sell the wildly valuable cyber-secrets for 1 million bitcoins, or about $560 million.During the months of August and September, the Obama administration was claiming that the devastating hack of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) by Guccifer 2.0 was a in reality a covert operation by the Russian FSB\u2019s Institute of Cryptography and Protection of Information (IKSI) that is tasked with cyber-warfare.President Obama used a press conference on August 4 regarding the DNC break-in to state, \u201cIf in fact Russia engaged in this activity, it\u2019s just one on a long list of issues that me and Mr. Putin talk about and that I\u2019ve got a real problem with.\u201dThe arrest of an NSA insider after two months of the President claiming the Russians were responsible for national security hacking raises concerns that his administration may have been using a \u201cfalse flag\u201d to cover-up their its own incompetence in protecting cyber-secrets from disgruntled or greedy employees.Following Snowden\u2019s 2013 intelligence breaches, the Administration\u2019s investigation and after-action corrective action plan should have entailed tremendous enhanced surveillance, countermeasures and staff vetting at Booz Allen to make sure that U.S. cyber-security operations are impenetrable from the outside and from the inside.Although Martin is suspected of taking the highly classified NSA \u201csource code\u201d developed to break into foreign computer networks, the Times reported late Wednesday that two intelligence sources tried to downplay the theft by claiming some of the information the contractor is suspected of stealing was \u201cdated.\u201dSnowden chimed in on Twitter from somewhere in Russia: \u201cThis is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?\u201dMr. Martin\u2019s lawyer, Jim Wyda, said the charges \u201care mere allegations \u2026 There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country. What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country.\u201d Wyda added that Mr. Martin \u201chas devoted his entire career to protecting America.\u201dBig Government, Breitbart California, Tech, Booz Allen Hamilton, cyber war, cyber-warrior, DNC, Edward Snowden, false-flag, FSB, Guccifer 2.0, hacking, Harold Martin, Harold Thomas Martin III, IKSI, Institute of Cryptography and Protection of Information, Intelligence, NSA, Obama administration, Russia, SCI, Sensitive Compartmented Information, Shadow Brokers, top secretComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

This measure would require that when state policymakers want to issue revenue bonds for a project that exceeds $2 billion, they must first\u00a0have\u00a0that approved by a vote of the people. This is a brilliant idea because, frankly, there is no adult supervision in the State Capitol. Special interests own the place, and since they make big bucks from state spending, it stands to reason they love to see any new revenues. This measure ensures a reasonable case for this epic amount of borrowing must be made to We, the People. I wrote about this measure in detail here.Prop. 54 \u2013 The California Legislature Transparency Act. The primary component of this measure sounds simple, but actually represents substantial reform. It would require that any proposed legislation in the State Capitol be made available to the public in its final form for 72 hours before it can be voted upon in each chamber. Yes, this continues the theme of applying adult supervision. I cannot tell you the number of terrible, horrible pieces of legislation that are jammed through at the end of session. Tax increases, new regulations, new programs \u2013 most that would raise a hue and cry of concern, except by the time the public finds out \u2013 it\u2019s too late. Read more about it here.Prop. 65 \u2013 Jam The Greedy Grocers. A couple of years ago, after trying about a hundred times, the enviro-extremists in the legislature passed a law banning single-use plastic grocery bags, and imposing a ten cent tax on each paper bag. The tax was set up in a way that the grocery stores pocket the ten cents. Before you scratch your head, let me explain further. For years the California Grocers Association was part of the coalition stopping the bag ban. But on this last go-around, they switched sides, as estimates pegged the grocers\u2019 revenues from the bag taxes at hundreds of millions of dollars. Enough voters signed petitions to halt the bag ban, and it has been placed on the ballot as Prop. 67 \u2014 on which I am voting \u201chell no.\u201d But in case it passes, I\u2019m \u201chell yes\u201d on 65, which would take the revenue from the greedy grocers and instead repurpose it to state environmental programs \u2013 and leave the sell-out grocers holding the bag, so to speak. I wrote about this here.Prop. 66 \u2013 Fix the Death Penalty, Don\u2019t End It. This would address legal and administrative hurdles that have resulted in only 13 death-row inmates being executed since 1978, in order to make the death penalty work. There is another measure on the ballot, Prop. 62, that would prohibit the use of the death penalty in California. If your value system is such that you think that no matter how despicable or evil someone is, and no matter how heinous an act of violence they commit, that being put to death by the state for your crimes is a bad idea \u2013 you\u2019d want to vote \u201cyes\u201d on 62, and \u201cno\u201d on 66. On the other hand, if you think that the death penalty serves as both an important deterrent to some who would commit the most horrible of crimes \u2013 often cold blooded, pre-meditated murder \u2013 and also provides for justice for surviving victims, then \u201cyes\u201d on 66 is an important vote to cast. Read more here.As you peruse the other thirteen ballot measures maybe you will find one or two you think are a good idea. Maybe you want more state bonds issued for school construction. Or maybe you want to be able, finally, to make those pot brownies that you\u2019ve been craving since your days at UC Berkeley. I will let you sort through those decisions. But I think you will find that higher taxes and more regulations are right there on the ballot, awaiting your blessing and vote.

The Obama administration sought to appease international outrage over its eavesdropping on foreign leaders, revealed in Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks about the National Security Agency, by transferring control of ICANN. Critics charge that there is no\u00a0international body currently capable of overseeing ICANN, and that without the antitrust exemptions it had formerly enjoyed under U.S. law, it will eventually come under the control of the United Nations\u2019 International Telecommunications Union, where repressive governments have considerable influence.Republican presidential nominee\u00a0issued a statement strongly opposing the handover of ICANN last month.Clinton led Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the overall poll, 44% to 43% in a four-way race, a result well within the poll\u2019s margin of error, and despite a majority saying that Clinton won the first presidential debate.\u00a0Libertarian Gary Johnson was third, at 4%, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein scored 1% of the vote.Joel B.

Street5 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook expects the United States economy to continue barely growing at a dismal 1.6 percent annual rate through 2016, increase to only 2.2 percent growth in 2017, and then begin to trend downward in later years. But global economic growth, at 3.1 percent, is expected to be twice as strong as the U.S. rate in 2016, improve to 3.4 percent in 2017, and then continue to outperform.IMF economists point to the U.S. elections and the Brexit vote as related phenomena that reflect \u201cpolitical discord and inward-looking politics\u201d as the main threat to further worsening in the global economic outlook.The IMF highlights the fact that international trade growth has dramatically slowed since\u00a02012, and has been running at a negative -3 to -5 percent since 2015. The IMF blames this global change\u00a0for\u00a0a substantial slowdown of investment that \u201chas been the primary restraint on trade growth, accounting for up to three-fourths of the slowdown.\u201d The IMF sees\u00a0this trend causing weak \u201cproductivity and growth.\u201dThe IMF notes\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s economic arguments, stating: \u201cConcerns about the impact of foreign competition on jobs and wages in a context of weak growth have enhanced the appeal of protectionist policy approaches, with potential ramifications for global trade flows and integration more broadly.\u201dThat is economist-speak for angry people that used to make a very good manufacturing wage in places like the U.S. Rust Belt and the British Midlands, and who may be gaining the political upper hand in rebelling against globalized outsourcing of their jobs to the Third World.The IMF suggests that advanced nations could subdue this rebellion with even greater welfare and entitlement spending policies that support \u201ctrade adjustment assistance programs and effective support for retraining, skill building, and occupational and geographic mobility could play an important role in certain cases.\u201dAfter four decades of pushing globalization as a great way to improve the lives of billions of people in developing nations, the IMF seems to be listening, at least,\u00a0to voices articulating the negative plight of millions of American workers.Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics, Donald Trump, globalization, IMF, International Monetary Fund, Outsourcing, stagnant growth, World OutlookComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak5 Oct 20160The federal lawsuit, filed by David Simon and Bryan Pease on behalf of a group called\u00a0\u201cUnited Poultry Concerns,\u201d targets Chabad of Irvine and another rabbi \u2014 even though previous suits have failed, in California and elsewhere, to show cruelty.The Chabad.org website describes the ceremony as follows:The rite consists of taking a chicken in one\u2019s hand and reciting a prayer. A man takes a rooster; a woman takes a hen; a pregnant woman takes two fowls \u2013 a hen and a rooster \u2026The fowl [or other animal] used for kapparot is taken in the right hand and the appropriate text from the prayer book is recited. The bird is then passed over one\u2019s head three times and the appropriate text is recited.The word kapparot [like kippur] means \u201catonement,\u201d and is used to refer to the chickens themselves, but one should not think that kapparot themselves serve as a source of atonement. Rather, they serve as a means to bring a person to the awareness that he might very well be deserving of death because of his sins and he will thereby be motivated to repent and ask G\u2011d for mercy.The fowl is then slaughtered in accordance with halachic [Jewish legal] procedure.It is customary to redeem the kapparot for money, which is then given to the poor; some give the fowls themselves to the poor. Others perform the entire rite only with money, reciting the prescribed verses and giving the money to charity.Kosher slaughter\u00a0prevents any suffering to an animal. In the case of chickens,\u00a0the birds are not beheaded, as in conventional slaughter, but are killed with a single incision to the neck.According to the\u00a0Orange County Register, the lawsuit states:\u201cThis sickening spectacle is scheduled to be repeated again beginning on the weekend of Oct. 8, 2016,\u201d Pease wrote in a Sept. 26 filing with the U.S. District Courthouse in Santa Ana. \u201cHowever, killing chickens is not required for Kapparot to take place, but is simply a preference. Many other entities have stopped killing chickens and instead perform the ceremony by swinging small bags of coins overhead.\u201dYom Kippur, the annual Jewish day of atonement, begins in the evening of Tuesday, Oct. 11 and ends after nightfall on Wednesday, Oct. 12. During the day, Jews abstain from food, drink, sex, bathing and wearing leather. Most of the day is spent in prayer, asking for forgiveness for sin, not just individually but for the Jewish community and the world in general.The kapparot ritual is not required by Jewish law but is a beloved custom among some religious Jews.Joel B.

It argues that Sikh and South Asian students are also targeted, mistakenly,\u00a0by anti-Muslim bullying because of the way students may dress or look.There is nothing in the bill about bullying of Christian or Jewish students, whether by Muslims or other students.Anti-Jewish rhetoric and antisemitic attacks are a serious problem at several universities in California.\u00a0A recent study found that of the top ten most antisemitic campuses in the U.S., six were in California, and five were from the University of California system.

Street5 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The monster Category-4 Atlantic hurricane, packing winds of 140 miles per hour, is on a path to strike Southern Florida on Friday morning, then drive up the center of the state. The storm appears to have more than enough power to veer right to hammer Georgia and the Carolinas, then move north, bringing torrential rain and flooding to the East Coast.Jason Rasgon, associate professor of entomology and disease epidemiology at Penn State University, warned AccuWeather that Zika mosquitoes are so light and unaffected by raindrops, they will be picked up and blown to a new area as the Matthew advances.There is no vaccine or treatment for the Zika virus, making prevention essential. Early on in the American Zika outbreak, public health officials falsely believed that Zika virus transmissions would remain limited to individuals that became infected through travel outside the continental U.S. to places where Zika is common, like Brazil and Puerto Rico.But with two new locally-infected Zika cases being reported in Miami Beach and another four more in Miami-Dade County, the potential Zika pandemic now has confirmed 139 cases caused by domestic transmission. The CDC reports that there are confirmed 718 travel-related Zika infections recorded in Florida, with 103 involving pregnant women.Zika is\u00a0symptomatic for only 18 percent of cases. If symptoms appear, they are usually associated with a mild flu fever, joint pain, muscle pain, headache and red eyes. Consequently, the Zika infection rate is drastically underreported.\u201cVector borne diseases\u201d\u00a0such as dengue fever, malaria, yellow fever, and Zika infect over one billion people and kill over one million people per year. Zika is easily spread by 1) mosquito blood bite; 2) mother-to-child; 3) sex; 4) saliva; 5) urine; 6) blood transfusion; and 7) research laboratory exposure,\u00a0according to the CDC.For the first time in its 70 year history, the CDC warned Americans on August 1 not to travel to an American neighborhood for fear of catching an infectious disease. The CDC advised\u00a0pregnant women and their partners not to travel to a Zika-infested community near Miami that had 14 cases in a neighborhood with 200 homes and businesses.According to the World Health Organization\u2019s \u201cZika Virus Microcephaly\u201d Situation Report, dated September 29, there are now confirmed Zika cases in over 70 countries. Indigenous domestic strains are now native to South America, North America and Asia.The United States Center for Disease Control and Florida Homeland Security officials have gone all-out since August 4 with aerial and ground spraying in the Miami-Dade County \u201cDanger Zone\u201d to kill the common Aedes aegypti mosquitos that carry Zika virus.CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters\u00a0that Miami-Dade\u2019s aerial spraying of the insecticide Naled \u2014 in a fine mist fired from planes about 100 feet off the ground \u2014 was found to kill more than 90 percent of mosquitos in the 10-mile square area in Miami\u2019s Wynwood area, where the first U.S. locally-transmitted Zika cases were found.Hurricane Matthew will force an aerial pesticide spraying halt in South Florida on October 4, because it is ineffective in heavy winds. The storm\u2019s up to 25 inches of rain are expected to cause widespread flooding that will drastically increase mosquito breeding.Florida Gov. Rick Scott has desperately warned residents and business owners to drain standing water from their properties before and after the hurricane to limit mosquito population growth.\u00a0Big Government, Breitbart California, Science, Danger Zone, Hurricane Matthew, Miami, Miami-Dade County, microcephaly, pandemic, vector borne, WHO, World Health Organization, ZikaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street4 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Tesla has bet the farm on their \u201cAutopilot System\u201d as a disruptive innovation that allows its all-electric Model S and Model X SUV to independently travel, steer and brake along public streets and freeways.Although Tesla operators were noticed that they are supposed to be ready to grab the wheel and step on the break whenever an emergency presents itself, there are plenty of videos with Tesla drivers jumping in the back seat to play video games or take a nap.As a consequence, there have been about a dozen Tesla Autopilot crashes. The worst incident was a fatal May 7 crash where a Tesla driver appears to have been watching a Harry Potter video while \u201cAutopilot\u201d drove his car into a T-bone with a commercial big rig.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)\u00a0Office of Defects\u00a0probe\u2019s initial report stated that the Tesla Model S on autopilot\u00a0was speeding and never braked when the car approached a tractor trailer making a legal left turn.Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk claims the coming updated Autopilot System will make vehicles more reliant on radar versus cameras, a move Musk called a \u201cdramatic improvement\u2019 that could have prevented the recent accidents.But most Wall Street analysts believe that those changes are the result of Tesla\u2019s key supplier of semi-autonomous car technology, Israeli-based Mobileye\u00a0NV, canceling their joint-agreement to provide the computer chips and algorithms that drive \u201cAutopilot.\u201d Mobileye had warned Tesla not to promote the technology as capable of \u201cself-driving.Despite dumping Tesla, Mobileye still has agreements to supply camera-based driver-assistance systems to over a dozen other auto makers including General Motors,\u00a0Nissan Motor\u00a0Co., BMW,\u00a0AG, and Hyundai Motor that account for more than 60 percent of Mobileye\u2019s sales.The California DMV rates Tesla\u2019s Autopilot as just a \u201clevel-two version\u201d of self-driving technology, based on\u00a0a five step scale adopted by the federal government and the auto industry.\u00a0The DMV draft regulations will only allow vehicles rated at levels three, four or five to advertise they have any self-driving capable while functioning on \u201cauto-pilot.\u201d\u201cLevel-three\u201d vehicles will be allowed to only drive themselves under limited conditions without a human occupant paying attention and ready to intervene. To be a level five vehicle, the car must be able to operate on a fully automated basis under the mot sever conditions.Tesla\u2019s spokeswoman e-mailed the San Francisco Chronicle, \u201cTesla is reviewing the draft regulations and will provide input to the DMV as appropriate.\u201d She added \u201cAutopilot makes driving safer and less stressful, and we have always been clear that it does not make a car autonomous any more than its namesake makes an aircraft autonomous.\u201dTesla is pushing innovation, but Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0in October 2015 that Consumer Reports pulled Tesla Model S\u2019s perfect 100-point score as \u201cbest car ever,\u201d after receiving 1,400 responses from owners over the following month that complained about squeaks, rattles, and multiple electric motor replacements. Consumer Reports\u00a0revised its score for a new $127,820 Model S to a \u201cworse than average\u201d 43, after a study\u00a0warned\u00a0that 2/3 Tesla\u2019 cars will need entire drivetrain replacements before they reach 60,000 miles.Consumer Reports in July of this year argued that\u00a0Tesla should stop using the \u201cAutopilot\u201d name because, \u201cIt\u2019s really a driver-assist technology. CR called the advertising it as \u201cAutopilot \u2014 that was outrageous.\u201d Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit group that has been critical of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot deployment, cheered the draft regulations, \u201cThe advertising regs are exactly what\u2019s required.\u201dCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown\u00a0signed a bill into law on September 30 that does allow autonomous vehicles to operate on public roads without a driver, steering wheel or human-operated breaks. Companies can now test wat is expected to be driverless shuttles if they meet a 15-point federal safety assessment guidelines and have a two-way communication link between the vehicle\u2019s passengers and a \u201cremote operator.\u201dBreitbart California, Tech, Auto-pilot, automated, autopilot, BMW, California, dmv, driver-assisted, GM, governor jerry brown, Mobileye, self-driving, TeslaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

It was as if someone were to throw a bomb in the middle of downtown, it\u2019s no different, it\u2019s the same thinking.\u201d\u201cComing back from Afghanistan, thinking I\u2019m on home soil I\u2019m safe now\u2026 just shouldn\u2019t have to worry about something like that, you know,\u201d he also said.In explaining why he crashed into the veteran\u2019s automobile, Fakhraldin also cited what he described as Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump\u2019s mistreatment of minorities.Alcala was on his way from Fresno to San Jose to play golf with his father when the disturbed driver slammed into him.\u201cI saw the Suburban coming right at me about to T-bone right into the driver door and I thought that was it. A second later I turned my head and just smashed into the barrier,\u201d said the Veteran.Fox News reports:Alcala said that when an off-duty police officer went to talk to Fakhraldin, he said that he caused the collision in the name of Allah. He also cited Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s treatment of minorities for why he caused the crash.Fakhraldin told an officer at the scene that he estimated his own speed to be 200 mph and that he caused the crash using psychic/telekinetic powers to control the steering. The officer said Fakhraldin showed no remorse, Fox 26 reported, citing the police report.Jihadi groups such as al Qaeda and its rival the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) have urged supporters to target military personnel. Various \u201ckill lists\u201d containing personal information about U.S. service members, government employees, and civilians have been published online by jihadists.It remains unclear how the Fakhraldin chose Alcala as a target or if he was affiliated with any specific Islamic extremist group. In July, a jihadist in France plowed a 19-ton truck down Nice\u2019s Promenade des Anglais and into a crowd assembled for a July 14 fireworks display, killing 86 and wounding more than 200. His victims include children.The carnage ended when police killed the armed truck driver, Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, after he drove onto a sidewalk for more than a mile. Bouhlel is believed to have been inspired by ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the attack.Both al-Qaeda and ISIS have urged jihadists to carry out vehicular assaults against Western countries in the absence of more conventional weapons.Breitbart California, Jihad, National Security, Allah, California, veteransComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Phillip A. Talbert. Flames destroyed six homes and triggered mandatory evacuations of several communities in both counties\u2026Ranchers spotted Garcia-Avalos carrying his 4-year-old son on his shoulders west of the Cedar Creek Campground area, where the fire had been reported, according to a U.S. District Court complaint. They suspected he started the fire and offered to help, but he said he was OK. Still, ranchers recorded the conversation with an iPhone.Garcia-Avalos told the ranchers that his car had been stolen and that his son saw the man who took it, and that he was walking home to Delano, which is more than 42 miles away from the Cedar Creek area, according to an affidavit written by U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Brian Adams.The ranchers were able to convince Garcia-Avalos to enter their home so that he could call someone for help. During the visit, they asked him several questions about the fire, and Garcia-Avalos denied responsibility, prosecutors say.At the crash site, fire investigators found a burned vehicle and shoe prints belonging to a small child and an adult. The shoe prints led investigators from the car to Highway 155.Garcia-Avalos was sentenced to seven months in prison for lying to U.S. Forest Service law enforcement officers and six months for starting the Cedar Fire. After serving his 13-month sentence, he will be deported back to Mexico, when he\u2019ll start paying back $61 million in damages\u2014at the low cost of only $25 per month, or $300 each year. (At that\u00a0rate, it would take\u00a0Garcia-Avalos some 203,333 years to pay the total cost of the damages.)Sequoia National Forest, founded as a national park in 1890, holds the \u201cgreatest concentration of giant sequoia groves in the world,\u201d according to the U.S. Forest Service. The giant sequoia is the single species in its genus and grows naturally in only one area of the world, the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. These magnificent trees are the oldest and largest living things on Earth.Conservative author Ann Coulter documents the sickening destruction of national parks and forests at the hands of illegal aliens setting up drug farms or attacking law enforcement as they break into the country. \u201cDespite the evidence adduced by the GAO showing that illegal immigrants are both the single largest cause of wildfires and also the biggest impediment to extinguishing them, the government report dared not suggest building a fence,\u201d she writes. \u201cInstead, our government decided that 100 percent of the price of illegal aliens\u2019 fire setting should be paid by Americans.\u201dIllegal aliens have little\u00a0respect for the American tradition of preserving natural wonders and biodiversity, Coulter writes in Adios, America:The environmental damage done to federal parkland by the Mexican pot growers is breathtaking. According to USA Today, the illegals \u201cscar the landscape by crudely terracing hillsides that erode under winter rain. They spill pesticides, fertilizer and diesel fuel used to power generators that run extensive drip-irrigation systems. They dam creeks for water sources, plant salsa gardens, disfigure trees and leave behind tons of garbage, human waste and litter.\u201d Park officers find deer carcasses hanging from trees, owls impaled on posts, and claws from grisly bears displayed as trophies. Except for one fully brainwashed government official, who said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to single out one group,\u201d there was no mistaking who was dumping pesticides, chopping down trees, and threatening hikers in our parks\u2026The Mexican assault on America\u2019s national parks goes well beyond what is absolutely necessary to cultivate marijuana crops. Reporters who have visited the sites gape in horror at the trash illegal aliens have left behind. Amid the plethora of two (2) New York Times stories on the pot farms, one said that law enforcement officers have found \u201celaborate tree-houses, makeshift showers and, invariably, trash and pesticides, much of which ends up in streams and creeks.\u201d The Fresno Bee reported that the illegal immigrants leave behind \u201ctons of trash\u201d in addition to poaching deer and other park animals. The Los Angeles Times said of one camp: \u201cTrash was strewn everywhere\u2014 empty cans, torn packets of noodles, a crusty leather rifle scabbard. A soggy sleeping bag was stuffed behind a tree.\u201d The chief law enforcement officer at Sequoia National Park\u00a0swept his hand toward the piles of trash, saying, \u201cNice, eh? Welcome to your national park.\u201dGarcia-Avalos also holds a criminal record including burglary and car theft charges.

Its official name is l\u2019Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s.Kardashian is a social media icon that regularly \u201cscapes\u201d her days and nights to over 50 million social media followers worldwide. She began Sunday morning by attending the Balenciaga designer show on Sunday morning, where she shocked the audience by sitting in the front row without make up.Kardashian later joked on Twitter as she left the show that her huge bodyguard, Pascal Duvier, \u201cconsistently photobombs\u201d her should-be solo paparazzi pics. Kardashian complained that he \u201cis always in my shot!\u201d It is believed that Duvier stayed constantly close to Kardashian from early Sunday morning until late that evening.Kardashian went back to the \u201cNo Address Hotel\u201d in the early afternoon, where she changed into a\u00a0lacy and silk lingerie-inspired look. She was then driven to the Givenchy SS17 fashion show, where she sat in the front row to watch her younger sister Kendall Jenner\u00a0strut the runway in honor of Jenner\u2019s September \u201ccover shot\u201d for Vogue Magazine.Transported back to the \u201cHotel,\u201d Kardashian seems to have then made another trend-setting outfit change for the late afternoon social media updates on Snaphat.Kardashian then changed into her final outfit of the day, in what was described as a risqu\u00e9 all-matte python ensemble. She was driven from the \u201cHotel\u201d in the early evening with Duvier to attend an exclusive dinner hosted by fashion designer Azzedine Alaia at his Paris home.In what appears to be Kardashian\u2019s last social media post before the robbery, she shared a video of herself \u201cFaceTiming\u201d with her future sister-in-law\u00a0Blac Chyna, who was in Los Angeles, California hosting a celebration at her baby shower.CNN\u00a0is reporting:\u201cThe French Interior Ministry said five men threatened the mansion concierge with a weapon, handcuffed him and forced him to open the private apartment. Two of the men were able to gain entry to Kardashian West\u2019s room, according to the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office, and a gun was held to her head\u2026.

Pollak4 Oct 20160Back in July, when Clinton and Donald Trump\u00a0announced their respective running mates, it seemed that\u00a0the vice presidential debate might actually overshadow the presidential bouts, given that Pence and Kaine have more impressive resum\u00e9s in public life than either of the people that selected them.\u00a0Both men have been governors; Pence built a solid reputation as a leader on Capitol Hill, while Kaine was one of the Democrats\u2019 more respected voices on foreign policy on the Sunday talk show circuit.But since then, Pence\u00a0has rocked the campaign trail, while Kaine has been\u00a0a wet rag. While Pence has played\u00a0to packed houses across the country, Kaine has struggled to draw anyone at all, even in swing states where the contest is closest.Thus far, Kaine\u2019s only noteworthy contributions to his side\u2019s efforts have been his repeated, shrill accusations that Donald Trump is associated with the Ku Klux Klan, and his lies defending Clinton on her mis-handling of classified information.Overall, Pence has been a net positive for the Trump campaign, reassuring the public that Trump will a) appoint competent people to high posts, and b) be replaced by a capable leader, should the worst happen.By contrast, Kaine has been a net negative for the Clinton campaign. He seems to have been chosen for the sole reason that he would not overshadow her on stage. In fact, when they appear together, she seems more likely to lose. It is difficult to imagine Kaine running the country.The pattern is unlikely to change on Tuesday. Kaine will be sent onstage with a set of attack lines against Trump to reinforce Clinton\u2019s talking points from the last debate. Pence\u2019s job will be to look presidential, a task Kaine will make easier for him.The conventional wisdom is that vice presidential debates do not matter much. But they do affect a campaign\u2019s momentum.In 2008, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin stunned a skeptical media, which expected her to fail, by outperforming then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE). The result was renewed zeal on the campaign trail for a ticket that appeared to be flagging since the first debate and the disastrous decision of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to suspend his campaign during the financial crisis.In 2012, Biden put Barack\u00a0Obama\u2019s re-election effort back on track after the president was beaten badly by Gov. Mitt Romney in the first debate. Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who had prepared well for a genteel\u00a0battle of wits and policies, was stunned by Biden\u2019s antics and outbursts, which seemed clownish but successfully conveyed contempt for Ryan to a national audience.Pence will not only\u00a0give the Trump campaign a boost, but also force the media to consider, once again,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s health issues, which remain shrouded in mystery, as well as her judgment, which Trump has repeatedly called into question.That, in turn, will set Trump up for the remaining two debates \u2014 and, perhaps, for one last, and decisive, surge in the polls.Joel B.

Street3 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Lanzillo on August 22, 2012 placed a tracking device on then conservative Costa Mesa Mayor Jim Righeimer\u2019s car to set up a crooked DUI entrapment scam during budget and union contract negotiations, according\u00a0to Orange County prosecutors. He and former Riverside detective Scott Impola, are still awaiting trial. He then used a GPS tracker to electronically follow the Mayor home from a local bar, and then called 911.Costa Mesa Police Officers responded, detained Righeimer, and administered a field sobriety test. The city cops seemed surprised when the Mayor passed a field sobriety test. At a news conference shortly thereafter, Mayor Righeimer provided a restaurant receipt listing that he had only been drinking Diet Coke.Lanzillo is alleged to have been aided and abetted by a second private investigator named Scott Impolo, a former Riverside detective that is still awaiting trial. The goal of the effort funded by the Costa Mesa Police Association, has been alleged to dig up dirt on the then mayor and Councilman Stephen Mensinger, who is currently the Mayor of Costa Mesa.Both private detectives had pleaded not guilty. But at a pre-trial hearing in Santa Ana courthouse, Lanzillo reversed his plea and admitted to four felony counts tied to the false DUI report against City Councilman Jim Righeimer and for using another GPS tracking device to tail current Costa Mesa Mayor Stephen Mensinger.Righeimer made a statement following Lanzillo\u2019s guilty plea:\u201cThis case revolves around the Costa Mesa Police Association hiring private investigators to get information to extort elected officials for the benefit of their member\u2019s salary and pensions. This is pure political corruption. Mr. Lanzillo and Mr. Impola worked at a law firm that represented over 130 Police Officer Associations. They worked full-time getting dirt on elected officials that could be used later to extort these same elected officials when their contract came up for negotiation.\u201dThe union representing Costa Mesa police has acknowledged hiring Lanzillo and Impolo\u2019s employer, the now-shuttered law firm Lackie, Dammeier, McGill & Ethir, to investigate Mensinger, Righeimer, Costa Mesa Councilman Gary Monahan, and candidate Colin McCarthy for \u201ccandidate research.\u201dThe Costa Mesa Police Association has vehemently denied for four years knowing about any illegal actions on the part of the law firm they hired or its investigators during a period that the City Council was considering outsourcing city services.Senior Deputy District Attorney Robert Mestman confirmed to the Orange County Register that Lanzillo was not offered a plea deal, instead admitting to all the charges he was facing. He added, \u201cI think it speaks to the strength of our case,\u201d Mestman said.Mayor Mensinger to the Register, \u201cI think the message is clear, that unions and their candidate operatives who are involved in extortion and dirty tricks will see justice served cold,\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m elated with the plea and my family can put this chapter of the ongoing union nightmare to rest.\u201dMr. Lanzillo is scheduled to face up to a four years and four months prison sentence at a hearing on January 13, 2017.Breitbart California, Social Justice, Christopher Joseph Lanzillo, Cosst Mesa, Costa Mesa Police Association, DUI, police union, Scott ImpolaComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street3 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0The Chicago-based FND Films comedy troupe that including Aaron Fronk, Vinny DeGaetano and Cooper Johnson created an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in 2014 for their first film. They had hoped to raise $72,000, but actually pocketed over $77,000.But then the crew took the money and disappeared without ever giving the donors any updates on the movie or their fate. But in mid-September, FND Films went on YouTube to post a video apologizing that due to \u201ccomplications and elements\u00a0beyond their control\u201d, the movie could not be completed. The complications seemed to be FND partying.The video apology caused lots of outrage, until FND Films acknowledged that the \u201creal\u201d movie plot for \u201cIt\u2019s All Good\u201d is a comedy about their own wacky venture as millennial losers that teamed to raise $77k on Indiegogo, but blew most of the cash on cocaine, limousines, champagne, and hookers. They claim they finally had to actually make the film\u00a0because some of their unsavory donors got rough and forced them to finish the flick.FND President Fronk told Esquire the prank was planned from the start and it was\u00a0very stressful to keep the plot secret for two and a half years. \u201cWe felt this was a unique move, something that had the potential to get big, so we ran with it,\u201d Fronk added:\u201cThe whole thing has been a tricky process\u2014we were constantly worried about blowing it. We needed a catalyst for why the money was gone, but you have to ride the line where it\u2019s a believable scenario\u2013Lying to people for two and a half years is rough\u2014we\u2019ve had to take a hit in our careers because we wanted to make it look like we disappeared. We couldn\u2019t tell certain actors in the film what the movie was about, and you\u2019ve got these people who donated thousands of dollars based on the most vague pitch that you can\u2019t clue them in. I\u2019ve so badly wanted to say, \u2018No no no, it\u2019s just a joke.\u2019\u201dAs the first crowdfunding, the real Indiegogo reports that they have more than 2.5 million people from 226 countries and territories that made over $800 million in cash commitments for 175,479 deals they call \u201ccreative, entrepreneurial and cause-related projects.\u201dAlthough many crowdfunded deals have gone on to actually make products and services, Indiegogo reports only a couple have gone on to attract venture capital. Like all business start-ups, a huge number of Indiegogo deals end up having low to no return for their donors.The \u201cIt\u2019s All Good\u201d trailer announcing an October 21 release is truly hilarious. It also seems that it will be easy for FND Films to leverage the story line into a great cable comedy series about how dumb and crooked crowdfunders squander their donors\u2019 cash in \u201ccreative, entrepreneurial and cause-related\u201d partying.Big Hollywood, Breitbart California, Tech, crowd funding, donors, Indiegogo, It's All Good, venture capitalComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Pollak3 Oct 20160It was the latest betrayal in Sanders\u2019 continuing capitulation to the Clinton machine, which began with the first Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas last October, and became impossible to ignore at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.The first days of the convention were marked by spirited protests by Sanders supporters from the floor of the Wells Fargo Arena. Supporters were particularly outraged at Clinton, given the revelations by Wikileaks that the Democratic National Committee had colluded with the Clinton campaign to deny Sanders a fair chance at winning the nomination.But even as party officials literally turned out the lights on Sanders delegates to drown them out, Sanders did nothing in their defense.Instead, Sanders did Clinton the honor of personally handing her\u00a0Vermont\u2019s delegates, even as hundreds of his delegates walked out of the hall in protest. Still, Sanders supporters were not ready to blame him for what had happened. At private meetings between the delegates and their candidate, there were hugs and tears, but few questions about why Sanders could have allowed millions of voters to believe in his promised \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d when he had no intention of leading one.Though he is technically \u201cindependent,\u201d Sanders has proved he is a Party man. There is apparently no amount of corruption by Hillary Clinton\u00a0that would arouse his condemnation, and no insult to his supporters that would provoke him to rise to their defense. His\u00a0\u201cpolitical revolution\u201d was little more than a vanity project, and possibly an AstroTurf operation designed to lure otherwise discouraged Democrats back into the voting booth.Sanders\u2019 new vacation home does not appear to have a basement.2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Breitbart California, basement-dwellers, Bernie Sanders, CNN, demexit, Jake Tapper, parents' basement, State of the UnionComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Street2 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0Hurricane Matthew reached Category 5 status in the early hours of Saturday morning, becoming the first to do so since Hurricane Felix in 2007. At its peak that day, Matthew\u2019s 160 miles-per-hour winds were as powerful as Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, which is rated as \u201cthe most destructive storm in the U.S. modern history.\u201d However, the storm weakened in the last 24 hours to a still-ferocious Category 4 storm, with winds of up to 150-mph winds.As the most ferocious Atlantic hurricane in almost a decade, the double-eyed Matthew is set to hit land at the Southern tip of impoverished Haiti on Tuesday morning.With Hurricane Matthew moving at a 6 mile-per-hour clip, the U.S. National Weather Service expects the storm to dump an average of between 15 to 25 inches of rain on Haiti, with as much as 40 inches in some areas.\u201cThis rainfall will produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,\u201d the National Weather Service warned on Sunday, \u201cPreparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.\u201dCivil protection officials throughout the Caribbean are broadcasting warnings of a coming storm surge, stating that southern low-lying areas will be \u201chighly threatened\u201d from the approaching storm system and urging people to prepare emergency survival kits.According to the US National Hurricane Center\u2019s (NHC) latest projection, Matthew is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through at least Monday night. After hitting Haiti and Jamaica on Tuesday morning, Matthew is expected to reach Cuba by late evening.The current track indicates Matthew will smash directly into the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, or Gitmo. The Naval command is evacuating hundreds of personnel, family members and non-essential staff from Gitmo\u00a0to a Florida base, according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.\u201cThe remaining military and civilian personnel will shelter in place and be able to support recovery efforts once safe to do so following the storm\u2019s passage,\u201d the Navy said in a press release.The exact path of the monster storm is indeterminate at this time, and Matthew\u2019s destructive power could increase substantially if it veers out to warm ocean waters, where it would pick up huge strength before veering back to clobber the East Coast.At a minimum, Hurricane Matthew will begin moving up the U.S. southern East Coast with winds of at least 110 miles-per-hour on Thursday morning. The U.S. National Weather Service predicts dangerous swells, coastal flooding, and beach erosion as far north as Virginia, but warns that the Mid-Atlantic and New England states could be affected within two weeks.\u00a0Big Government, Breitbart California, Environment, Cat 4, Cat 5, Category 4, Category 5, Cuba, Flooding, Guantanamo bay, Hurricane Felix, Hurricane Gilbert, Hurricane Matthew, landslides, U.S. Naval BaseComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

That may not sound like such a high probability, but it was a 7.8 magnitude quake that destroyed the Bay Area in 1906.The turn-of-the-century Great San Francisco Earthquake and resulting fires caused an estimated 3,000 deaths and $524 million in property loss. Buildings and structures were damaged in all parts of the City and County of San Francisco. In the downtown business district, which was built on ground made by filling in the cove of Yerba Buena, pavements were buckled, arched, and fissured; brick and frame houses were extensively or destroyed; sewers and water mains were broken; and gas pipelines caught on fire and caused a conflagration.Ground movements between three feet up and down, plus 15 feet sideways, were common in the City. The catastrophic quake caused similar damage for almost 100 miles, from lightly populated Mendocino County to Santa Clara County.Kelly Huston, the deputy director of crisis communications for the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, said the heavy intensity and strategic location of the swarm at the end of the San Andreas Fault caused the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services to issue the extreme warning, which will last through October 4.The southernmost tip of the San Andreas Fault has been building up pressure since Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake of 1700 that was the largest known to have occurred in the \u201clower 48\u201d United States. It rocked from California to Southern British Columbia. It also set off a tsunami that not only struck the Pacific coast, but also crossed the Pacific Ocean to Japan, where it damaged coastal villages. Written records of the damage in Japan pinpoint the earthquake to the evening of January 26, 1700.Morgan Page, a geophysicist with the U.S.G.S. Earthquake Science Center, told the Daily News that there is a common misconception about earthquakes that smaller ones relieve pressure on a fault and reduce the chances of a major earthquake happening. He warned that, \u201cLittle quakes can actually trigger more powerful ones\u201d and \u201cthere is significant stress stored on the southern end\u201d of the San Andreas Fault.Breitbart News reported in 2014 that after two decades of mild and intermittent earthquake activity, California suffered four very serious high magnitude quakes in 2014 that included the 6.8 magnitude Cape Mendocino quake on March 9; the South Napa magnitude 6.0 on August 23; the 5.1 magnitude La Habra quake on March 28; and the 4.4 magnitude Westwood quake on March 17.The South Napa quake that hit at 3:20 a.m. was especially concerning because it featured an \u201cEarthquake Storm\u201d with 60 smaller aftershocks\u00a0ranging in size from 0.6 to 3.6 on the\u00a0Richter scale.Geophysicist\u00a0John Dvorak, author of the book \u201cIs California Overdue for a Big Earthquake?\u201d,\u00a0warned in a Christian Science Monitor interview that a series of increasingly higher intensity earthquakes could now be building over an extended period in California. He cautioned, \u201cA lengthy vacation from earthquakes certainly sounds nice,\u201d but a quake break can just be the calm before the earthquake storm.Breitbart California, Economics, Environment, california governor, Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake, earthquake storm, Great San Francisco Earthquake, Is California Overdue for a Big Earthquake?, Jerry Brown, Office of Emergency Services, South Napa Quake, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S.G.S.

Street1 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0According to Gail Tverberg, who prophetically warned on January 6, 2008, in The Failure of Networked Systems\u00a0that banks and insurance companies were about to cause a worldwide financial crisis, just warned that \u201cLeaders around the world have demanded that their countries switch to renewable energy, without ever taking a very close look at what the costs and benefits were likely to be.\u201dWith Gov. Brown signing Senate Bill 32 (SB 32), California committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2017 to 40 percent below by 2030.California\u2019s 2015 Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) is now 2/3 wind and solar, and about 1/3 biomass geothermal and small hydro. The bulk of future RPS greenhouse reductions are expected to come almost exclusively from wind and solar.Tverberg says this commitment to solar and wind has been justified by simple calculations of \u201cLife Cycle Assessment\u201d and \u201cEnergy Returned on Energy Invested.\u201d But she argues, \u201cThese calculations miss the fact that the intermittent energy being returned is of very much lower quality than is needed to operate the electric grid.\u201dThere are four parts to managing an electrical grid: 1) create a network by building connections between power sources; 2) when a particular part of the network approaches excess demand (goes red), recognize this is happening and use the grid connections to switch demand to another network power source; 3) continue doing this until all areas are red; 4) and then begin rationing demand through black-outs.With California at 12.3 percent intermittent wind and solar electrical penetration in 2015, Tverberg points out that the state is suffering the same type of electric grid degradation that Hawaii is currently suffering with 12.2 percent solar and wind penetration.Hawaii is an island chain that cannot import energy to their electrical grid. With $331 million invested in Hawaii during 2015, its installed solar capacity hit 615 megawatts, supposedly \u201cenough solar energy installed in the state to\u00a0power 159,000 homes.But due to the intermittent challenge of needing an equal amount of standby electrical generation for periods of overcast or darkness, Hawaii has been forced to stop residential solar net metering\u00a0(giving homeowners credit for the retail cost of electricity, when electricity is sold to the grid) and\u00a0is phasing out these solar subsidies.Tverberg highlights that the intermittent \u201csituation is\u00a0not too different in California.\u201d Due to solar and wind subsidies that have driven electrical costs to 45 percent higher than the national average, over 1/3 of California\u2019s electric grid power for non-intermittent (also called \u201cdispatchable\u201d) electrical back-up must now be imported from other states, up from only 25 percent in 2010.California\u2019s solar and wind electricity generation falls quickly in the summer as the sun is setting. This period of declining availability is almost exactly the same period that the demand for \u201cdispatchable\u201d electricity to power air conditioning spikes \u2014\u00a0between 5 and 9 p.m.California claims to be reducing the \u201cstate\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d but about 80 percent of California\u2019s rapidly rising electrical imports come from fossil-fuel power plants, \u201csix percent from coal-fired plants\u201d, and up to 14 percent from nuclear.With Gov. Brown\u2019s RPS demanding rapid increases in solar and wind power generation, California\u2019s electric grid is on a crash course to exceed its ability to import enough \u201cexcess\u201d dispatchable power from other states.Tverberg believes that, due to the requirement for non-intermittent \u201coperating reserves\u201d to allow the electric grid to maintain stability, there is an \u201capparent \u201clid\u201d on intermittent electricity at 10 percent to 15 percent of total electricity consumption.\u201dBreitbart California, Environment, Tech, biomass, black outs, dispatchable, Energy Returned on Energy Invested, Gail Tverberg, geothermal and small hydro, Greenhouse Gas, Life Cycle Assessment, peak renewables, Renewables Portfolio Standard, RPS, SB 32, Senate Bill 32, solar, windComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.
