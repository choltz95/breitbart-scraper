The State Department said that as a result, it revoked the visas of nearly 60,000 people. Those visas were subsequently reinstated when the Trump order was put on hold by a federal court.In another change, the order no longer will temporarily ban travel to the U.S. by Iraqis.White House Proposes Cutting State Department Budget 37%The Trump administration is proposing to cut spending by 37% for the State Department and its foreign-aid division.Click to Read StoryTrump Looks to Jump-Start Momentum on Key InitiativesPresident Trump, in an address to Congress on Tuesday, will look to jump-start momentum on top White House and congressional initiatives, including enacting a new health-insurance system and overhauling the tax code.Click to Read StoryTrump to Sign Bills Repealing Obama-Era Regulations on Firearms, WaterPresident Trump\u00a0is set to sign bills repealing Obama-era regulations on water and firearm purchases by some people with mental-health issues, as well as a bill affecting an initiative to asset historically black colleges.Click to Read StoryAdvertisementSenate Confirms Wilbur Ross as Commerce SecretaryThe Senate confirmed Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary Monday, an appointment key to allowing President Donald Trump to make progress on his campaign promise to overhaul U.S. trade policy.Click to Read StoryJustice Department to Ease Up on Probes of Police DepartmentsAttorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department will likely pull back from the investigations into alleged abuses at municipal police departments.Click to Read StoryTrump Vows to Press Ahead With Rewrite of Obamacare, Despite Political RisksPresident Donald Trump, heading into a critical stretch of Republicans\u2019 push to rewrite the Affordable Care Act, acknowledged Monday the effort would be complex and politically risky, but said he is determined to forge ahead because the ACA is a \u201cdisaster.\u201dClick to Read StoryAdvertisementTRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYSTogether, these changes\u2014and others\u2014significantly scale back the original order, but could put it on firm political and legal footing. Exempting existing visa holders could help the government\u2019s case in court by focusing more directly on individuals who haven\u2019t previously been granted approval for U.S. travel.The new order also is expected to remove a provision giving preference to refugees who are members of religious minorities, which was expected to benefit Christians coming from Muslim nations, several people said, another change that could help the government\u2019s constitutional case in court.The revised order also is expected to again temporarily suspend the admission of refugees to the U.S., but unlike the original, it is likely to treat Syrian refugees the same way as those from other countries, according to two people familiar with the planning. The original executive order suspended the entire refugee program for four months and indefinitely suspended admission of Syrian refugees.The people familiar with the planning cautioned that changes were still possible before the final order is issued. A White House spokesman declined to comment.The original order temporarily banned travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, with the White House citing terrorism concerns. Two people familiar with the discussions said Iraq would be removed from the list, given that many people coming from there helped the U.S. military or had family members who did.The other countries on the original list are Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. The Trump administration singled out the seven countries as posing a particular terrorism concern. Officials said people from these countries had been singled out for tighter scrutiny under the Obama administration.But last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that a Department of Homeland Security intelligence report found that immigrants from these seven countries pose no particular risk of being terrorists, contradicting the White House claims.DHS said its staff \u201cassesses that country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity.\u201d In response, the White House said the report was politically motivated and poorly researched.Under the original order, legal permanent residents, or green-card holders, weren\u2019t permitted to return to the country, though White House officials subsequently said they were. The new order will make clear that green-card holders are exempt from the ban, several people said.The revised approach including only new visa applicants is meant to address concerns raised by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which stayed several key provisions of the original order.The federal appeals court said the original order likely violated constitutional due-process protections for travelers excluded from the country, because they weren\u2019t given notice of the policy or a chance to challenge their denial of entry into the U.S. It is possible the administration could avoid the same kinds of due-process issues by focusing on foreigners who don\u2019t have green cards or visas in hand, meaning they haven\u2019t been previously approved for U.S. travel.The president has broad powers over U.S. borders, but judges have said those powers aren\u2019t absolute. No court has issued a final ruling on the original executive order, but judges across the country found preliminary legal problems with the Trump administration\u2019s initial order.While the Ninth Circuit focused on the due-process issue, a Virginia federal judge ruled two weeks ago that the travel ban likely violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination by singling out Muslims.Not all courts have ruled against Mr. Trump. A federal judge in Boston sided with the president.One expert in immigration law predicted that even with these changes, a new executive order would still run into legal jeopardy.Jonathan Meyer, who was deputy general counsel at DHS in the Obama administration, said the courts are likely to continue to see the order as religious discrimination, based on past proposals by Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign and statements by one of his top supporters that characterized the effort as a Muslim ban.\u201cNo rewrite of the order can retract those statements, so it doesn\u2019t look like the First Amendment problem will go away,\u201d Mr. Meyer said.Many of the cases remain pending, though any legal challenges may have to start afresh if the new order fully replaces the old one.The Justice Department has said in recent legal papers that the old order would be rescinded and replaced, but White House press secretary Sean Spicer has made public statements that were more equivocal about the old order.\u2014Shane Harris and Brent Kendall contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T13:21:00.000Z", "title": "President Donald Trump plans to issue new executive order restricting travel", "id": "SB10765718591853224623104582650152386032394"}, {"author": "Christopher Whittall", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-markets-higher-ahead-of-trump-address-1488332430", "tags": ["asian shares", "asia stocks", "djia", "donald trump", "dow jones industrial average", "equity markets", "european markets s&p 500", "fed", "federal reserve", "fed rate raise", "janet yellen rate raise", "markets", "nikkei", "stock markets", "stoxx 600", "trump", "Federal Reserve", "William Dudley", "Donald Trump", "Janet Yellen", "regulation", "government policy", "corporate", "industrial news", "political", "general news", "politics", "international relations", "domestic politics", "debt", "bond markets", "money", "forex markets", "foreign exchange news", "commodity", "financial market news", "government debt", "national government debt", "corporate digests", "routine market", "financial news", "financial investments", "security brokering", "dealing", "financial services", "investing", "securities"], "content": "Global stocks marched higher while the dollar rose and government bond prices fell Wednesday, as investors focused on suggestions from Federal Reserve officials of a coming rate rise and digested President Donald Trump\u2019s speech to Congress.Futures markets pointed to a 0.5% opening gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Soon she may have no building at all.Last week, the Israeli military deemed the entire village was constructed illegally, setting the stage for the school and other buildings here to be razed. A lawyer for the village said he expected an Israeli demolition order on Thursday.The ruling put this ramshackle village of 35 Bedouin families settled over half a century ago at the center of the conflict over who should govern the West Bank.Some of Khan Al Ahmar\u2019s 170 residents say Israel just wants the land to expand a nearby Jewish settlement. They argue that demolition would indicate that Israel is no longer committed to a peace deal that allows for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, a so-called \u201ctwo-state solution.\u201d Israel says its goal is merely to take down illegal structures.Indications from Israel and U.S. President Donald Trump that they aren\u2019t wedded to a two-state solution have deepened unease among Palestinians.\u201cMany people within the Israeli government have taken the election of Trump as an opportunity to bury the two-state solution,\u201d said Xavier Abu Eid, a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization, which negotiates with Israel. \u201cOne way to do that is through the forcible displacement of people from their homes.\u201dIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is committed to achieving a peace agreement with Palestinians, but recently sidestepped questions about whether that included the creation of a Palestinian state.The Oslo Accords of the 1990s\u2014the U.S.-brokered blueprint for peace between Israel and the Palestinians\u2014divided the West Bank into three parts ahead of negotiations on a final peace agreement. Area A contains the main Palestinian population centers and is administered by the Palestinian Authority. Area B is controlled by both Israel and the Palestinians. Israel controls Area C, which makes up roughly 60% of the West Bank and is where settlements are located.Some lawmakers in the ruling coalition, including Minister of Education Naftali Bennett, say they want to formally make Area C part of Israel and give citizenship to the Palestinians living there. Around 300,000 Palestinians lived in Area C in 2014, according to the U.N., as did 385,900 Jewish Israeli settlers, according to the CIA World Factbook.Demolitions of Palestinian homes in the West Bank increased after Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government came to power in May 2015. Last year, the army razed 867 Palestinian homes in Area C, nearly twice 2015\u2019s demolitions.Israeli Declared East JerusalemGreen LineNo Man\u2019s LandOslo AgreementArea BArea AArea CNature ReserveFull Palestinian civil and security controlFull Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security controlFull Israeli control over security, planning and constructionSpecial CaseJeninMediterraneanSeaNetanyaTulkaremNablusWEST BANKTel AvivRamallahRehovotJerichoJerusalem10 miles10 kmBethlehemMed.SeaLEB.SYRIADeadSeaHebronDetailISRAELJORDANEgyptGreen LineNo Man\u2019s LandIsraeli Declared East JerusalemOslo AgreementArea BArea AArea CNature ReserveFull Palestinian civil and security controlFull Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security controlFull Israeli control over security, planning and constructionSpecial CaseJeninMediterraneanSeaNetanyaTulkaremNablusWEST BANKTel AvivRamallahRehovotJerichoJerusalem10 miles10 kmBethlehemMed.SeaLEB.SYRIADeadSeaHebronDetailISRAELJORDANEgyptNo Man\u2019s LandIsraeli Declared East JerusalemGreen LineOslo AgreementArea BArea ANature ReserveArea CFull Palestinian civil and security controlFull Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security controlFull Israeli control over security, planning and constructionSpecial CaseJeninMediterraneanSeaNetanyaTulkaremNablusWEST BANKTel AvivRamallahRehovotJericho10 milesJerusalem10 kmBethlehemMed.SeaLEB.SYRIADeadSeaHebronDetailISRAELJORDANEgyptGreen LineNo Man\u2019s LandIsraeli Declared East JerusalemOslo AgreementArea AFull Palestinian civil and security controlArea BFull Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security controlArea CFull Israeli control over security, planning and constructionNature ReserveSpecial CaseJeninNetanyaTulkaremNablusWEST BANKRamallahRehovotJerichoJerusalemBethlehemDeadSeaHebron10 miles10 kmLEB.MediterraneanSeaSYRIADetailISRAELJORDANEgyptSource: United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian AffairsSome opponents of the demolitions say Israel is trying to force Palestinian communities in Area C to move closer to Palestinian cities so they won\u2019t vie with Israelis for land.\u201cThis larger policy is designed to allow Israel to hold as much land as possible with as few Palestinians on it as possible,\u201d said Amit Gilutz, spokesman for B\u2019Tselem, a left-wing nongovernmental organization that monitors demolitions of Palestinian homes.\u201cThis is a step towards annexing C, resulting in the killing of the two-state solution,\u201d said Khan Al Ahmar village spokesman Eid Khamis Jahalin.Israeli officials reject such allegations. They say demolitions are the result of court rulings against illegal construction and aren\u2019t connected to settlement expansion. Israel doesn\u2019t consider settlements or demolitions an obstacle to a peace agreement.Israeli officials note that buildings constructed illegally in Jewish settlements also are demolished. On Tuesday, the military began evacuating nine homes in a Jewish settlement that the high court said were built on Palestinian land. Last month, the army evicted 300 Israelis from an illegal outpost, called Amona, for a similar reason.U.N. officials argue that the situation is different for Palestinians, who seldom receive permission from the Israeli military\u2019s Civil Administration, which administers the West Bank, to legally build. The Civil Administration didn\u2019t provide numbers of Palestinian building permits issued in recent years.Khan Al Ahmar was settled by Bedouins displaced during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The village, with its school and dwellings of wood and corrugated metal are now wedged between two Jewish settlements.Some Israeli lawmakers in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s ruling coalition hope to expand one of the settlements, Ma\u2019ale Adumim, and make it the first Jewish settlement the government formally annexes. They have drafted a bill to achieve that end.The village is accessible by a dirt track from a highway between that links Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. The school was built in 2009 with funding from European nongovernmental organizations.The Civil Administration said it plans to move the Palestinian Bedouin in Khan Al Ahmar and other Bedouin in Area C to a planned community near Jericho where \u201cthe families will be assigned plots of land that include residential infrastructure such as water, electricity, and sewage, while maintaining the population\u2019s lifestyle.\u201dLast week, the Israeli military delivered \u201cstop work\u201d notices to the Khan Al Ahmar school and other buildings here\u2014a formal step in the process leading to demolition.In the office of Ms. Zahayka, the head teacher, maps of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip adorned the walls alongside pictures of the late Yasser Arafat, the late Palestinian leader. Nearby, children bent over open textbooks.\u201cWe will never leave this area,\u201d Ms. Zahayka declared. \u201cEven if they demolish, we will teach on the ruins.\u201dWrite to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T13:03:00.000Z", "title": "Residents cry foul as Israeli military prepares to raze Bedouin village in West Bank", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582649582739638686"}, {"author": "Kate Milani", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2017/03/01/capital-journal-trumps-speech-to-congress-marks-a-shift-in-tone/", "tags": ["Capital Journal Daybreak"], "content": "TRUMP\u2019S SPEECH TO CONGRESS MARKS A SHIFT IN TONE: President Donald Trump, after reaching the White House with fiery rhetorical attacks and a combative message, pitched his agenda to voters and Congress with language that was much more presidential and traditional in tone.

Its overseas motorcycle sales rose 2.3%, partly offsetting a 3.9% decrease in the U.S.One of the biggest overseas markets is Japan, a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade criticism, where people like 61-year-old retiree Masayuki Takeuchi have helped make Harley-Davidson models best-sellers in the big-engine category.\u201cI get a sensation that I cannot get from Japanese-made ones,\u201d said Mr. Takeuchi, who recently bought a Harley-Davidson.\u00a0\u201cThe beefiness and the sound are unique to Harley.\u201dIn 2016, the company sold nearly 11,000 motorcycles in Japan, high tariffs. That success is a sharp contrast to American car makers, which collectively have less than 1% of the Japanese market and lag German makers.Mr. Trump recently invited Harley-Davidson executives to Washington for a meeting and posed with the motorcycles on the White House lawn. In his address to Congress Tuesday, he said he asked the executives how their international business was doing.\u201cThey told me\u2014without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it\u2014that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that one country taxed the motorcycles at 100%.\u201cThey weren\u2019t even asking for change. But I am,\u201d he said.The president didn\u2019t identify the country with 100% taxes or tariffs on motorcycles, but a manager at a Harley-Davidson dealer in India said the high tariff applies to fully assembled motorcycles entering the country. That duty applies to Harley-Davidson V-Rod and Touring models sold in India, the manager said.India applies a 100% import duty on motorcycles, according to the website of the country\u2019s Central Board of Excise and Customs. Harley-Davidson India representatives couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment, and calls to the company\u2019s Japan office weren\u2019t answered.Harley-Davidson set up an Indian assembly plant in 2010 to avoid higher taxes on its motorcycles. It introduced a motorcycle with a smaller engine in 2014, which the company said it hoped would help drive sales in India. Most motorcycles riders in India use two-wheelers with smaller engines than are typically found on a Harley.India places high tariffs on a variety of luxury imports. That issue and other barriers such as local-ownership rules have long been a point of contention between New Delhi and Washington.Japan doesn\u2019t have any tariffs on imported cars or motorcycles, but companies do have to jump through some hoops to get their vehicles on Japanese streets. Pollution and noise regulations mean that Japanese Harley-Davidsons \u201care the quietest machines in the world,\u201d said Kenji Noma, who owns a dealership in eastern Tokyo. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201dAt Mr. Noma\u2019s store, a sound system plays classic rock while customers browse over the dozen models on the floor or shop for headbands and leather jackets.The dealer said his biggest problem wasn\u2019t trade barriers but the nation\u2019s aging population. Many customers, he said, started riding Harleys decades ago. Now some members of the store\u2019s Harley club are dropping out, saying their knees hurt or their doctors ordered them to stop riding.\u201cThese people used to put up with Hondas and Suzukis, while dreaming of one day owning a Harley,\u201d said Mr. Noma. \u201cEventually their dream came true. Now, they\u2019re getting old.\u201d\u2014Anant Kala in New Delhi contributed to this article.Write to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T12:52:00.000Z", "title": "Trump puts spotlight on Harley-Davidson\u2019s overseas sales challenges     ", "id": "SB11455692400262464455204582651421609663632"}, {"author": "Nina Trentmann", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2017/03/01/the-morning-ledger-presidents-speech-leaves-executives-wanting-more-details/", "tags": ["MORNING LEDGER"], "content": "Good morning.

Mr. Trump opened his first congressional address with a call for unity over attacks on Indians in Kansas and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries: \u201cWe are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\u201d He then offered guidelines for Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, and find an elusive compromise on an overhaul of immigration laws. Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to persuade his fellow Republicans will be the first major test of his leadership after an erratic start to his administration.

Sales of vehicles made by Volkswagen\u2019s Bentley, Ferrari, Fiat\u2019s Maserati, Porsche and BMW\u2019s Rolls-Royce jumped an estimated 18% since the U.S. presidential election through January, compared with the same period in 2016.

An always-on work culture, combined with feelings of job insecurity and directives to do more with less\u2014even when business is booming\u2014has driven workers to the breaking point, they say. And the problem appears to be worsening, resulting in steep turnover and health costs.

Adams of Indiana said: \u201cI am in favor of increasing spending on our defense capabilities. But I am also in favor of an in-depth analysis of ways to make military spending more efficient\u2026With the size of the budget and the nature of federal administration of any program, I am convinced there is plenty of room to get more for our investment in the military.\u201d Zach Robock of Ohio commented: \u201cWhile there is merit to deterrence through military strength, the U.S. already leads the world in military spending by several orders of magnitude. This money would be better spent on infrastructure\u2014from a national security standpoint and for creating jobs and economic growth.\u201d And John Radick of Pennsylvania weighed in: \u201cI agree completely with Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed increase in military spending and upgrade. A stronger military = a safer country = a safer world. However, I don\u2019t think the amount he is requesting is enough to properly provide our military with the manpower, equipment and supplies truly needed to protect our nation.

The operation was ordered by President George W. Bush\u2019s administration as part of its so-called extraordinary rendition program.A judge had also indicted a number of Italian intelligence officials, but they weren\u2019t convicted after evidence was excluded due to national security concerns.Ms. de Sousa has denied any involvement in the kidnapping, claiming that she was skiing in northern Italy at the time of the incident.While the other Americans convicted in the case left Italy before their indictments, Ms. de Sousa, who holds both Portuguese and American citizenships and has family in Portugal, chose to remain in Europe. She moved to Portugal in 2015. Soon after her arrival there she was detained on a European arrest warrant.The pardon now means Ms. de Sousa will avoid prison. She was originally sentenced to seven years in jail, but that was later cut to four years. Mr. Mattarella\u2019s pardon will now reduce Ms. de Sousa\u2019s sentence to three years. According to Italian law, a three-year jail term can be served outside of prison, under house arrest or by performing community service.The Italian president\u2019s decision also ends a battle to extradite Ms. de Sousa to Italy to serve out her original sentence. After Tuesday\u2019s pardon, an Italian magistrate withdrew the order for her arrest, which was the basis of a request by the Italians to extradite the former CIA operative.The 61-year-old was detained in early February and sent to jail in the Portuguese city of Porto after the country\u2019s constitutional court upheld a lower court\u2019s order to extradite her to Italy.Ms. de Sousa now has 30 days to ask the court in Italy to serve out her sentence under house arrest or community service. According to her lawyer, differences among European Union countries on rules regarding house arrest and community service mean it isn\u2019t clear whether Ms. de Sousa can serve her sentence in Italy or Portugal. He said she likely will go to Italy voluntarily to clarify her position with Italian authorities.The development apparently brings to an end a long battle that revived tensions over the extraordinary rendition program put in place soon after the Sept. 11 attacks.Trump administration officials expressed alarm over the February extradition order, and had voiced disappointment over Ms. de Sousa\u2019s conviction and sentence. U.S. officials indicated then that they had been in touch both with Ms. de Sousa and with Italian and Portuguese officials in a bid to work out a solution.The White House said in a Feb. 23 public statement that \u201cthe U.S. government takes its obligation to assist U.S. citizens overseas seriously,\u201d while not describing the extent of the administration\u2019s involvement or the details of any talks.

Two of the biggest online brokerages are waging a fee war of their own that is taking the cost to trade stocks and funds ever lower.Hours after Fidelity Investments on Tuesday released plans to lower online trade commissions on U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds to $4.95 from $7.95, Charles Schwab volleyed back, matching that price. Schwab already cut its online trade commissions for U.S. stocks and ETFs earlier this month to $6.95 from $8.95. The firm also matched Fidelity\u2019s option pricing at 65 cents per contract.TD Ameritrade Holding and E*Trade Financial, two other brokerages that stoked a prior price war as online brokerages boomed in the late 1990s, charge $9.99 per online stock trade.The price cuts are a way for brokerages to capture growing sums of money flowing into ETFs, lower-cost products that track the performance of a basket of securities but trade on exchanges like stocks. Assets in U.S. ETFs surged to $2.5 trillion at the end of last year from $938 billion five years earlier, according to consulting firm ETFGI LLP. Schwab, Fidelity and other large brokerage firms also offer commission-free trading for a number of ETFs.Asset-management firms that provide the funds brokerages sell have been equally aggressive about pulling down fees. In some cases, that means the cost of investing is tumbling toward zero. By the end of 2015, the most recent year for which data are available, 348 mutual funds and ETFs tracked by Morningstar charged investors 0.1% or less, up from 125 such funds five years earlier.Below, some of the best analysis and insight from WSJ writers and columnists, and occasionally beyond, on investing, the wealth-management business and more.TALKING POINTS\nMorgan\u2019s tax flub.

A little more than a month before the Labor Department\u2019s fiduciary rule is supposed to kick in, its fate is still up in the air. The Office of Management and Budget has finished its review of the delay the DOL is considering, determining that the delay the department is eyeing is \u201ceconomically significant.\u201d Erin Sweeney, attorney at Miller & Chevalier Chartered who specializes in fiduciary obligations, said the OMB decision means the DOL has two choices: conduct a more robust analysis of a delay\u2019s implications, or opt for a shorter delay that the OMB might not deem economically significant.

But they haven\u2019t decided what should be taxed at 25%, as a firm\u2019s business income, and what should be taxed at 33%, as the owner\u2019s wages at the firm.The rules would affect millions of business owners whose income passes through to their individual tax returns rather than appearing on corporate filings. They include law firms, hedge funds and manufacturers and they are a powerful force in Republican politics. They range from tiny businesses to the enterprises of some of the wealthiest Americans.Clarene Law said a lower tax rate on pass-throughs would free up capital to add rooms to her hotels in Jackson, Wyo. or buy new air conditioners and washing machines.White House Proposes Cutting State Department Budget 37%The Trump administration is proposing to cut spending by 37% for the State Department and its foreign-aid division.Click to Read StoryTrump Looks to Jump-Start Momentum on Key InitiativesPresident Trump, in an address to Congress on Tuesday, will look to jump-start momentum on top White House and congressional initiatives, including enacting a new health-insurance system and overhauling the tax code.Click to Read StoryTrump to Sign Bills Repealing Obama-Era Regulations on Firearms, WaterPresident Trump\u00a0is set to sign bills repealing Obama-era regulations on water and firearm purchases by some people with mental-health issues, as well as a bill affecting an initiative to asset historically black colleges.Click to Read StoryAdvertisementSenate Confirms Wilbur Ross as Commerce SecretaryThe Senate confirmed Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary Monday, an appointment key to allowing President Donald Trump to make progress on his campaign promise to overhaul U.S. trade policy.Click to Read StoryJustice Department to Ease Up on Probes of Police DepartmentsAttorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department will likely pull back from the investigations into alleged abuses at municipal police departments.Click to Read StoryTrump Vows to Press Ahead With Rewrite of Obamacare, Despite Political RisksPresident Donald Trump, heading into a critical stretch of Republicans\u2019 push to rewrite the Affordable Care Act, acknowledged Monday the effort would be complex and politically risky, but said he is determined to forge ahead because the ACA is a \u201cdisaster.\u201dClick to Read StoryAdvertisementTRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS\u201c25% if it\u2019s pure, not all cobbled up with a bunch of surtaxes, it would be a great benefit,\u201d said Ms. Law, chief executive officer of Elk Country Motels Inc. Her businesses own more than 400 hotel rooms and generate revenue of more than $10 million a year, she said.The nettlesome issue of pass-through taxation has been overshadowed by other debates over the House Republican tax plan, including a border adjustment that would tax imports and exempt exports. Still, the details of pass-through taxes are crucial to the structure, arithmetic and politics of the Republican tax agenda.If they apply the 25% liberally to pass-through income, the federal government could lose hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue and create a new form of widespread tax avoidance. They could also create inequities, with law firm associates paying the 33% top rate on wages while their bosses, the partners, pay 25% on income for similar work.On the other hand, if lawmakers narrowly restrict what counts as business income at the lower rate, they will meet strong opposition from pass-throughs, which have clout within the GOP and will argue they can\u2019t compete with corporations.One approach is simple but rigid\u2014taxing 70% of all pass-through income as wages\u2014and would meet business backlash. More nuanced approaches would add complexity to the system.Under current law, income earned by pass-through businesses, which also include sole proprietorships and S corporations, is taxed at individual rates up to 39.6%. That is close to the corporate tax rate of 35%. Corporate income faces a second tax when paid out as dividends, leaving little distance between the total tax burden on pass-through firms and corporations. Because House Republicans want to lower the corporate rate to 20%, pass-through firms want to follow that rate lower.Pass-through income is heavily concentrated; more than half goes to the top 1% of households, according to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. President Donald Trump\u2019s businesses are almost all pass-throughs. He also has proposed lower rates for them.Republicans are planning to advance their tax agenda using procedures that don\u2019t require any votes from Democrats, who generally warn that GOP tax plans are too tilted to high-income households.Lowering pass-through tax rates will help businesses keep more earnings so they can hire and expand, said Emily Schillinger, a Ways and Means Committee spokeswoman. \u201cWe are working to design this provision so that it is easy for businesses to apply and provides them with the certainty they need,\u201d she said.Central to the debate is how much of an owner\u2019s income would be counted as \u201creasonable compensation\u201d taxed at the personal rate of up to 33% and how much would be counted as firm income taxed at the lower 25% rate.\u201cReasonable compensation is inherently a factual question, hard for the IRS to audit, hard to catch somebody who\u2019s undervaluing their services,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a lawyer and senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. \u201cThese are pretty nimble taxpayers.\u201dThe IRS already struggles to police this area of the law and prevent S corporations from avoiding payroll taxes on what could be called wage income.Republicans have asked the committee staff to offer more options, said Rep. Kenny Marchant (R., Texas).They have a few choices, said a House GOP aide. One is a pure numerical split, allocating, say, 70% of pass-through income to wages and 30% to business profits. That is simple but politically toxic.\u201cIt\u2019s not a real 25% rate. That\u2019s more like a 31% rate, in which case you\u2019ve got trouble,\u201d said Liam Donovan, director of legislative and political affairs at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group. \u201cUsing a blunt instrument is a non-starter.\u201dA softer approach would set a formula like the 70/30 split, but allow businesses to argue for a more favorable allocation. Or Congress could let courts and the Internal Revenue Service develop rules over time.\u201cThis has to be dealt with,\u201d said the House GOP aide. \u201cHow you make this so this doesn\u2019t become a giant loophole, that\u2019s the part that\u2019s missing.\u201dAnother approach could create tests for businesses to separate wages from profits. Those factors could include time spent at the business, invested capital and comparable salaries at similar firms.That would get a more accurate result, but it would cause intensive audits and higher accounting costs for businesses.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of tax planning that goes into this to make sure they\u2019re doing it right,\u201d said Rep. Tom Rice (R., S.C.), a tax lawyer before he entered Congress.Republicans also must decide how to treat investment firms, which now consider their carried interest, or profit share, as lower-taxed capital gains. Critics say carried interest is equivalent to compensation for labor and it isn\u2019t clear how the tax rules for wages, business income and capital gains will apply to funds\u2019 fees and profits.Brian Reardon, president of the S Corporation Association, says pass-throughs can accept some gap between pass-through taxes and corporate taxes. But it shouldn\u2019t be bigger than 5 percentage points and it shouldn\u2019t be eroded through an \u201cartificial test\u201d redefining business income as wages.\u201cWe\u2019re actively working with the committee to actively identify ways of enforcing the new pass-through rate,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to be able to come up with something.\u201d", "date": "2017-03-01T10:30:00.000Z", "title": "The next issue confounding Republicans as they craft their tax overhaul.

Just not when it comes to their corporate pensions.Many German companies still operate huge traditional pension plans, which pay workers set sums after they retire. Yet thanks to permissive German pension\u00a0regulation, the companies don\u2019t have to sequester cash to meet those future costs.The results are ballooning pension deficits, thanks to persistently low interest rates, that critics call a time bomb for corporate Germany. At the end of October 2016, German companies listed on the blue-chip DAX index had pension obligations of \u20ac416 billion, yet had set aside just \u20ac245 billion, according to consulting firm Mercer. That ratio is far lower than in other major countries.The German approach is \u201can unserious practice [and] a risky bet on the future,\u201d says Dieter Truxius, dean at the University of Mannheim Business School.Standard & Poor\u2019s, the ratings firm, in September revised its outlook for  Deutsche Lufthansa AG to negative from stable, calling the enormous amount the airline owes current and future pensioners a \u201cmaterial credit weakness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very important issue for Lufthansa,\u201d said an airline spokesman.Lufthansa\u2019s pension obligations rose roughly 50% in the third quarter from the year earlier, to \u20ac10.5 billion, the spokesman said. Lufthansa is working to close its defined-benefit plans to new staff.Germany\u2019s pension problem has been compounded by its rapidly aging population, meaning many workers on defined-benefit plans are approaching retirement.\u201cIf low interest rates persist for a longer time, things could get tough when demographic shifts intensify,\u201d said Dieter Br\u00e4uninger, a pensions specialist at  Deutsche Bank.Low rates are now deeply ensconced in Europe, unlike the U.S., where a gathering economic recovery and the prospect of fresh government spending by the new administration of President Donald Trump have boosted long-term bond yields. A 10-year U.S. government bond yields 2.3%; a 10-year German bond, just 0.2%.In the U.S. and U.K., companies must squirrel away assets in special funds to cover pension liabilities. In France and many other countries, pensions are mainly government-managed.In Germany, where private-sector employees get corporate pensions on top of state pensions, companies decide for themselves how much money to set aside and in what way. Many companies dole out pensions from their bank accounts, similar to paying electric bills.Pension obligations are recorded as a liability on German-company balance sheets, but money isn\u2019t always set aside in a separate fund\u2014German companies take provisions for the part of their obligations that aren\u2019t funded, but those are simply accounting entries that can be undone.Experts say this method flatters German companies in comparison with U.S. and U.K. peers. \u201cGermany allows a financial flexibility to delay setting aside cash which can be fully reinvested to pursue strategic targets,\u201d said Kazim Razvi of Fitch Ratings.Germany\u2019s system works well in good times, when retiree numbers are low, and for growing companies. \u201cBut if a company must shrink because its plan didn\u2019t work out, it gets tough,\u201d said Mr. Truxius.A growing number of public companies\u2014especially large ones\u2014do set money aside in segregated investment vehicles. The blue chips listed on the DAX index have funding to cover 58% of their pension obligations, but that\u2019s around 20 percentage points below the international average, according to consultants Willis Towers Watson.Many Germans say the pension gap isn\u2019t concerning. Stephan Wildner, pensions specialist at Willis Towers Watson in Frankfurt, sees \u201cno reason to panic.\u201d\u201cGerman companies have put enough money aside and are doing well economically,\u201d he said.Heiko Massa-Wirth, a pensions expert at German steel producer  Salzgitter AG, said the larger concern is mortality\u2014that former employees outlive expectations. That is the \u201creal risk,\u201d he says, not low interest rates.But persistent low rates make the edifice shaky. When interest rates are low, pension provisions grow because projected financial returns drop. Even if just an accounting matter, those growing liabilities eat into shareholder equity.Thyssenkrupp AG\u2019s mounting pension provisions have sapped shareholder equity by \u20ac2 billion over three years, said Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff. \u201cOur book equity is to a large degree burdened by that.\u201dProfitable firms can withstand that crunch, but higher provisions can batter smaller or chronically unprofitable firms.Hardest hit by low rates are German midsize companies, who use different accounting rules that treat pension provisions more harshly.EDC GmbH, a producer of CDs and DVDs, was forced to file for bankruptcy last year after falling behind new-technology rivals. It also faced the burden of higher pension obligations, said Uwe Rittentropp, the company\u2019s top staff representative.\u201cIt was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d he said.Write to Natascha Divac at natascha.divac@wsj.com and Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T10:30:00.000Z", "title": "Ballooning pension deficits may take air out of corporate Germany\u2019s future ", "id": "SB10559519697244824476804582641820371963092"}, {"author": "Rebecca Byrne", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/03/01/wsj-city-shop-price-deflation-eases-trump-seeks-unity-credit-bubble-warning/", "tags": ["City of London", "WSJCity"], "content": "Good morning from London.

The co-founder of private equity behemoth Apollo Global Management said aggressive pricing for loans could be an indicator of a bubble, with the cheap availability of loans and lax covenants overloading the economy with debt. But he also predicted that a downturn is likely to be avoided by a period of \u201cturbo-charged\u201d economic stimulus.The Federal Reserve will be carefully considering whether to raise short-term interest rates at its meeting in two weeks, two top officials suggested, reinforcing recent similar messages from the central bank.

He also issued a call for American renewal in stark contrast to the aggressively nationalist posture he outlined at his inauguration just over a month ago.Mr. Trump opened his first address to a joint session of Congress with a call to unity in the wake of attacks on Indian nationals in Kansas and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries: \u201cWe are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\u201dHis speech largely avoided his signature attacks on his adversaries and the political establishment. While he once again highlighted the challenges of violent crime in some urban communities and drew attention to crimes committed by illegal immigrants, he didn\u2019t repeat his denunciation of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in his inaugural address.Although there were no major policy shifts\u2014he called for reworking trade deals and cracking down on illegal immigration without using the controversial \u201cAmerica First\u2019\u2019 label to describe them\u2014the edges of his most incendiary rhetoric were sanded off. It was the Trump doctrine with aspirational overtones.White House Proposes Cutting State Department Budget 37%The Trump administration is proposing to cut spending by 37% for the State Department and its foreign-aid division.Click to Read StoryTrump Looks to Jump-Start Momentum on Key InitiativesPresident Trump, in an address to Congress on Tuesday, will look to jump-start momentum on top White House and congressional initiatives, including enacting a new health-insurance system and overhauling the tax code.Click to Read StoryTrump to Sign Bills Repealing Obama-Era Regulations on Firearms, WaterPresident Trump\u00a0is set to sign bills repealing Obama-era regulations on water and firearm purchases by some people with mental-health issues, as well as a bill affecting an initiative to asset historically black colleges.Click to Read StoryAdvertisementSenate Confirms Wilbur Ross as Commerce SecretaryThe Senate confirmed Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary Monday, an appointment key to allowing President Donald Trump to make progress on his campaign promise to overhaul U.S. trade policy.Click to Read StoryJustice Department to Ease Up on Probes of Police DepartmentsAttorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department will likely pull back from the investigations into alleged abuses at municipal police departments.Click to Read StoryTrump Vows to Press Ahead With Rewrite of Obamacare, Despite Political RisksPresident Donald Trump, heading into a critical stretch of Republicans\u2019 push to rewrite the Affordable Care Act, acknowledged Monday the effort would be complex and politically risky, but said he is determined to forge ahead because the ACA is a \u201cdisaster.\u201dClick to Read StoryAdvertisementTRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYSIn shifting his tone, Mr. Trump signaled he was willing to set aside campaign-style rhetoric for a less divisive style more conducive to governing\u2014at least for the moment.He called for lower taxes on corporations and middle-class Americans, for replacing the Affordable Care Act, for rebuilding the military and enforcing border security. Those are all standard elements of Republican orthodoxy.He ticked off a series of initiatives that he believed could draw bipartisan support, such as making child care more accessible, ensuring paid family leave, supporting women\u2019s health and rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure.But despite the more unifying tone, the speech isn\u2019t likely to do much to help Mr. Trump get his stalled legislative agenda off the starting block. To move a tax overhaul through Congress, and a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, he needs a united GOP and support from at least some Senate Democrats. Right now he has neither. His long speech isn\u2019t likely to change that.The ceremonial setting of Tuesday\u2019s speech was emblematic of the pivot Mr. Trump faces at this point in his presidency. Delivering a formal address in the House chamber packed with the Washington establishment\u2014including both friends and foes\u2014was for Mr. Trump a far cry from the open-air campaign rallies and Inauguration Day address in which he fed off the energy of vast, admiring crowds.Mr. Trump made no real concessions to attract bipartisan support to his policy platform. His signature health and tax policy proposals are stalled in Congress, with his own party at odds. His immigration policy has been stymied in court. His first month as president has been roiled by staff turmoil and intrigue.He included in his list of bipartisan issues measures to \u201cpromote clean air and clear water,\u201d but his administration has been moving to roll back antipollution regulations. He called for rebuilding the military, without mentioning that his proposed increases in the Pentagon budget would be accompanied by deep cuts in domestic spending.He also signaled a willingness to negotiate on one of his signature issues: immigration.\u201cI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: To improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security and to restore respect for our laws,\u201d he said, although he didn't commit to considering the lightning-rod issue of granting legal status to some people in the U.S. illegally. Democrats are sure to demand that a legalization plan be part of any package.The speech came at a time of high risk for Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. Republicans are divided and looking to Mr. Trump for leadership on his plans to repeal and replace Obamacare and to revamp the tax code.If Mr. Trump fails to deliver on those signature issues, it will undercut a crucial element of his political brand: He campaigned on the promise that, as a successful businessman, he would be a problem-solving, no-nonsense deal-cutter who would succeed where traditional politicians had failed.The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests that for all the turmoil of the first month of the Trump presidency, many voters admire those qualities in him. A plurality of 46% rate him highly for his ability to \u201cget things done,\u201d and a plurality of 48% say he will bring \u201cthe right kind of change to the direction of the country.\u201dA key question is whether any Democrats in the Senate are open-minded enough to support any element of his agenda. He will need at least eight of them to move most legislation through the chamber. But many Democrats are under heavy pressure from the party\u2019s liberal, activist base to oppose Mr. Trump at every turn.His best hope is to draw support from 10 Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2018 in states that Mr. Trump won in 2016.\u201cThere are a lot of Democrats who will do nothing but gain by being part of the unbending resistance to Trump, but there are others who stand to lose,\u201d said William Galston, a former White House aide to President Bill Clinton who is now at the Brookings Institution.Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T06:05:00.000Z", "title": "Trump shifts his tone with more presidential and traditional speech, but not his policies", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582650673677261902"}, {"author": "Greg Bensinger", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ceo-says-he-needs-leadership-help-after-video-shows-him-slamming-driver-1488347091", "tags": ["vc industry news", "Uber Technologies", "Alphabet", "GOOGL", "Travis Kalanick", "Kalanick%2C%20Travis", "management", "corporate", "industrial news", "senior level management", "political", "general news", "retail", "wholesale", "etailing", "diversified holding companies", "business", "consumer services", "e-commerce", "internet", "online", "technology", "sharing economy services"], "content": "Uber Technologies Inc.

The company has been accused of permissiveness about sexism and sexual harassment in the workplace. Alphabet Inc. has sued Uber, alleging that some of the startup\u2019s employees stole self-driving-vehicle intellectual property.The ride-hailing company has also faced customer retaliation for appearing to undermine striking taxi drivers in New York, leading Mr. Kalanick to step down from an advisory group to President Donald Trump.On Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter, Uber forced out an engineering executive for failing to disclose allegations of sexual harassment at his previous employer, Alphabet unit Google.Mr. Kalanick drove Uber to become the most highly valued private startup in the world.In expressing contrition and a desire to seek leadership counsel, Mr. Kalanick appeared to be hewing to a Silicon Valley tradition where more-seasoned executives are brought in to help smooth out the rougher edges of startups\u2019 founders.

And every hurting family can find healing and hope.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s ability to persuade his fellow Republicans who control both the Senate and the House will be the first major test of his leadership after an erratic start to his administration.To that end, the president used much of his prime-time speech, his first before Congress, to highlight his own accomplishments after 40 days in office, but with more subdued tones and few policy surprises. Appearing practiced and calm, Mr. Trump almost exclusively stuck to his script, delivering none of the improvised zingers that tend to dominate headlines and overshadow his message.It was the kind of performance that Republican leaders have been waiting to see from the party standard-bearer. Heading into the speech, Republican lawmakers who control both the Senate and the House were looking for the president to jump-start momentum on their top initiatives.Leaving the speech, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said Mr. Trump hit a \u201chome run.\u201dBut Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a rising star in the Democratic Party, said Mr. Trump did little to meaningfully reach out to opponents of his policies.\u201cThis speech was more of the same fear and factual distortion that President Trump has made central to his campaign, transition, and first weeks in office,\u201d Mr. Booker said.The president laid out a set of guidelines without explicitly taking sides in the specific fights that are dividing the GOP caucus.Mr. Trump repeated his promise to overturn the 2010 health law, at a time when the party\u2019s factions are threatening to withhold support for the effort if their demands aren\u2019t met. He said a new health-care plan should ensure coverage for pre-existing conditions and minimize disruptions for people with coverage under Obamacare.He backed the use of tax credits to help people buy coverage, expanding health savings accounts to pay for treatment and said governors needed the resources to continue to fund their Medicaid programs for the poor.In the Democratic response, former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear said his party would oppose every GOP move to undo the 2010 health law they view as a signature domestic achievement of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.\u201cThis country made a commitment: that every American deserved health care they could afford and rely on,\u201d Mr. Beshear said. \u201cWe Democrats are going to do everything in our power to keep President Trump and the Republican Congress from reneging on that commitment. But we\u2019re going to need your help\u2014by speaking out.\u201dMr. Trump promised \u201cmassive tax relief\u201d for the middle class and lower tax rates for corporations. He said that his administration is developing a specific plan to do that.He echoed some of the language used by House Republicans in their controversial proposal for a border-adjusted corporate tax, one that taxes imports and exempts exports. He complained that other countries impose tariffs and taxes on American goods while the U.S. doesn\u2019t do so.Mr. Trump has wavered on the idea, and Tuesday night\u2019s comments brought him somewhat closer to House Republicans, who have seen their border-adjustment plan run into a buzz saw of corporate lobbying from retailers and sharp opposition from Republican senators.Mr. Trump essentially agreed with Republicans on the diagnosis without directly backing their prescription. \u201cWe must create a level playing field for American companies and workers,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump used the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d in talking about his immigration ban and the plan he ordered from the Pentagon to combat Islamic State.In an emotional high-point of the speech, he defended as highly successful a raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of a Navy special operator, William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, and singled out his widow in a moment that received extended rounds of applause. Mr. Owens\u2019s father has been critical of the mission, and declined to meet with the president to discuss it.\u201cRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cAnd Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he\u2019s very happy, because I think he just broke a record,\u201d the president continued, in one of the few quips that veered off his prepared remarks. The comment prompted a smile from Carryn Owens, his widow.Mr. Trump said it is \u201cnot compassionate, but reckless\u201d to forgo stricter vetting of those seeking to enter the U.S.Mr. Trump promised a multilateral approach to the fight, saying the U.S. \u201cwill work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\u201dSeparately, he offered one line about Iran and Israel. \u201cI have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel,\u201d he said.The speech marked Mr. Trump\u2019s first visit to the Capitol since he took office Jan. 20.\u2014Byron Tau and Carol E.

Currently such people declare themselves as \u201cwhite\u201d on the surveys.Such changes are significant because they shape how the U.S. tracks demographic change and can influence federal funding. It also has been controversial in the past\u2014in 2000, the Census Bureau apologized for its role in the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, an effort that tapped census tabulations. The federal government is now prevented by law from using such data for spying on Americans.Arab-American groups have pushed for a so-called MENA category for years, and some said Tuesday they were pleased to see it move closer to reality. But they also voiced concerns that Middle Easterners may be reluctant to check any box for fear of being stigmatized.The Census Bureau also called for creating a new scheme that counts Hispanics as a broad category in line with races like white and black. The agency noted that research showed nearly half of Hispanic respondents hadn\u2019t identified within any of the current federal race categories.The suggested changes are subject to further signoffs by the federal government, including Congress, which must receive a more completed proposal by April 2018.

That could help crack one of the toughest legislative puzzles lawmakers face, opening the door for progress on other business issues.Still, Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s speech did little to answer lingering questions about how his administration would tackle other big issues such as tariffs or trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, two issues many business executives are watching closely.Overhauling the tax code and immigration rules\u2014another idea floated by Mr. Trump\u2014\u201cwill be music to the business community\u2019s ears,\u201d said Jake Colvin, vice president for global trade issues at the National Foreign Trade Council, a business group. He added, however: \u201cUntil there are more details, it\u2019s hard to say how different segments of the business community might react.\u201dDoug Berenson, a managing director at defense consultant Avascent, said he wasn\u2019t surprised Mr. Trump didn\u2019t dip \u201cinto the weeds\u201d of defense funding plans in this speech though he said the appetite for more details remained.\u201cAs a defense budget analyst, I\u2019d like to know exactly what they\u2019re prepared to propose,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also very curious about how the various personalities and competing agendas within the Trump administration and the GOP leadership will come to agreement given widely divergent views on budgetary issues.\u201dThe president promised not only to \u201cbring back millions of jobs\u201d and establish \u201ca new program of national rebuilding\u201d for aging infrastructure. He also promised to make child care accessible and affordable and to \u201chelp ensure new parents have paid family leave.\u201d\u201cEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.\u201dMr. Trump again underscored the vital importance of\u00a0stimulating\u00a0more economic growth. \u201cTo accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy,\u201d he said, \u201cmaking it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave.\u201dHe said his administration is developing \u201chistoric tax reform\u201d to reduce business rates \u201cso they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.\u201d He added: \u201cIt will be a big, big cut.\u201d He also promised \u201cmassive tax relief for the middle class.\u201dMany firms as well as investors had a lot riding on Mr. Trump\u2019s address, given the potential impacts of some of his policy priorities, such as a tax overhaul and infrastructure spending.Joshua Bolten, president of the Business Roundtable, said Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cshould help build momentum for the kind of big tax reform this country needs for economic growth and the creation of more high-wage jobs.\u201dAlready in his first weeks in office, Mr. Trump has aligned himself closely with businesses, particularly manufacturers. He has announced a series of ambitious regulatory rollbacks and other actions, and even marked plant openings and aircraft launches, frequently surrounding himself with executives.The president also has made bold promises to deliver on some of the business community\u2019s long-sought legislative goals such as added infrastructure investment, as well as the tax and health care overhauls.\u201cThis is really our opportunity,\u201d said Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, whose group met with Mr. Trump last week.Small-business and consumer confidence, as well as stock indexes, have generally risen since the November election, and polls suggest voters largely view Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the economy more favorably than other aspects of his job performance.But despite the steady churn of White House activity, particularly on regulatory rollbacks, some observers have worried that the administration might be failing to do enough to solve key legislative disputes\u2014some of which reflect difficult disagreements within the business community itself.Target Corp., for example, warned that a feature of the House tax proposal known as border adjustment would raise prices on customers\u2019 everyday essentials because the chain relies heavily on overseas factories. CEO Brian Cornell said he and other retail executives made a \u201cvery important fact-based case\u201d against the measure when they visited Mr. Trump and congressional leaders in Washington earlier this month.Mr. Trump generally steered clear of the idea on Tuesday night.Some business leaders also have questioned whether Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to improve transportation and other infrastructure is sliding down the president\u2019s list of priorities.Thomas Pellette, president of heavy-equipment maker  Caterpillar Inc.\u2019s energy and transportation group, said at a recent investor conference that postelection optimism about Mr. Trump\u2019s construction plan has yet to translate into new projects.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s first stab at boosting military spending\u2014widely reported as a massive increase\u2014fell short of some businesses\u2019 expectations. The proposed rise to $603 billion for fiscal 2018 is only 3% above the plan outlined by the Obama White House, though Mr. Trump could surprise with additional spending under the so called war budget that circumvents budget caps.For their part, pharmaceutical industry executives were watching the speech closely for clues about how Mr. Trump might tackle high drug prices, an issue he has mentioned often since taking office.Mr. Trump called in his speech for working to \u201cbring down the artificially high price of drugs,\u201d but offered few specifics for doing so, which could be seen as a positive for drugmakers, said Geoffrey Porges, a biotechnology analyst at Leerink Partners LLC.Mr. Trump also praised the development of new medicines for rare diseases and pledged to \u201cslash the restraints\u201d that keep drugs from being approved faster by the Food and Drug Administration. He specifically praised John Crowley, a biotechnology CEO who helped develop a drug to treat a rare disease that his children suffer from. The drug costs more than $100,000 annually per patient.Leonard Schleifer, CEO of  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Tarrytown, N.Y., said he \u201cwas very pleased\u201d that the president in his speech seemed to distinguish between companies that habitually raise prices on older drugs, and those developing innovative new medicines whose prices reflect their research costs and \u201cthe value they bring to patients.\u201d\u200b\u2014Doug Cameron, Andrew Tangel and Joseph Walker contributed to this article.Write to John D.

Numbers over 50 indicate expansion from the month before.The Lunar New Year, when China shuts down for a week or more, came as one month gave way to the next, complicating interpretation of the numbers. But the data adds to evidence of a pickup in exports following several years of weakness.Wednesday\u2019s numbers highlight particular strength in equipment production, including electrical and information-technology equipment, which account for around half of China\u2019s exports by value. Profits at the country\u2019s publicly listed information-technology companies have also been on a tear, in contrast to slowing momentum in most sectors toward the end of 2016.Strong export growth could shore up the labor market in a politically sensitive year for China and offset slowing growth in the construction complex.But exports have been rising most rapidly to the U.S.\u2014and President elect Trump continues to fire protectionist broadsides against China and other Asian nations.

Finally, we have a letter to the editor on yesterday\u2019s chart comparing top personal tax rates.Your chart on personal federal tax rates is a little misleading regarding Switzerland.

Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) boycotted\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0speech. Some of her colleagues sought to display how they felt in more subtle ways.\u00a0Rep. Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.)\u00a0said he usually arrives early to such occasions to get an aisle seat within hand-shaking distance of the president, but not this year.A\u00a0group of Democratic women, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), dressed in white, a color associated with the suffragette movement to show support for policies such as equal pay for equal work and the women\u2019s health group Planned Parenthood, which Republicans want to stop funding.The guests in the chamber\u2019s gallery reflected the two parties\u2019 priorities and, as in the past, points they wanted to make. The president\u2019s side included:\u00a0Maureen McCarthy Scalia, the widow of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year; Jessica Davis and Susan Oliver, widows of two slain California police officers; and Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose son the White House said was killed nine years ago by an immigrant living in the U.S. illegally.The\u00a0Democrats\u2019 invited guests included refugees, Iraqi translators, and immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children\u2014representing fear over the direction of the Trump administration\u2019s tougher immigration policies.There were almost no Democratic hands to shake as Mr. Trump worked his way down the aisle before he began his speech. And many Democrats sat stone-faced as Republicans jumped to their feet in frequent clapping.As Mr. Trump himself noted, however, the biggest applause of the evening belonged to\u00a0Chief Petty Officer William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, who died in a raid earlier this month. His widow, Carryn Owens, applauded forcefully as tears streamed down her cheeks.Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T04:14:00.000Z", "title": "President Trump makes most of the moment in address to Congress", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582650693009854020"}, {"author": "Rachel Pannett", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/australia-avoids-recession-keeping-long-winning-streak-going-1488334978", "tags": ["australia economy", "australia end of mining boom", "australia gdp", "australia growth", "australia growth winning streak", "australia politics", "capacity", "facilities", "corporate", "industrial news", "natural reserves", "resources discovery", "economic performance", "indicators", "economic growth", "employment costs", "productivity", "employment", "unemployment", "government finance", "government budget", "taxation", "economic news", "real estate markets", "banking", "central banking", "credit", "financial services"], "content": "SYDNEY\u2014The longest ongoing streak without recession in the developed world just leapt over a big hurdle.Helped by rising commodity prices, Australia\u2019s resource-rich economy grew 1.1% in the three months through December from the prior quarter, beating the 0.8% forecast by economists. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, rose 2.4% from a year earlier, as company profits and government and consumer spending all expanded.A surprise 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter raised the specter of recession in Australia, as the commodity boom that underpinned the nation\u2019s long expansion\u201425 years and counting\u2014lost steam.But since then global commodity prices have rebounded, revitalizing Australia and other resource-dependent countries.Rising crude oil prices have boosted Canada\u2019s economy, which is expected to have registered 2% annualized growth when the figures are released on Thursday. GDP at western Europe\u2019s biggest crude oil producer, Norway, edged up in the fourth quarter.Australia\u2019s biggest export\u2014 the steelmaking ingredient iron ore\u2014has roared into 2017, with prices recently lifting to a 2-1/2 year high on optimism Chinese demand would prove robust. China is Australia\u2019s biggest trade partner.Still, commodities prices may not be out of the woods just yet. Mining executives are wary that coal and iron-ore prices, which surged amid renewed demand in China and reduced Chinese production, have risen too far too fast.Australia\u2019s top finance official, Treasury Secretary John Fraser, said Wednesday the outlook for the nation\u2019s economy was still \u201cfinely balanced,\u201d despite the rising prices for key resource exports. While there were positive signs in the global economy, he said it was too early to assess what the impact of new U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies and rollback of free trade might be.\u201cAustralia\u2019s economy is still working through a complex transition away from mining investment and towards broader growth, in an uncertain international economic climate,\u201d Mr. Fraser said.Australia\u2019s plan to shift investment away from mining to focus more on other industries like services has been slow to materialize. Companies scaled back investment spending by 2.1% in the three months through December from the quarter before. Economists had forecasted a 0.5% decline.Many of Australia\u2019s biggest companies are hoarding cash. Cash levels in the six-month period ending December rose by 9% to about 108 billion Australian dollars (US$83 billion), according to CommSec, close to the highest point in the 14 earnings seasons the online broker has covered.Mining companies have chosen to use a recent surge in profits largely to reward investors, not launch big new projects. Both British-Australian miner  Rio Tinto PLC and BHP Billiton raised their dividends after announcing robust profits in recent weeks.On the employment front, while Australia\u2019s jobless rate has fallen recently, many of the new jobs being created are part-time positions in services, such as cashiers and baristas. That is contributing to weak wage growth and stubbornly low inflation, since wages are a major business cost.Record-low interest rates\u2014now at 1.5%\u2014have fanned a property boom, which has underpinned household spending but also led to record high levels of debt.House prices in Sydney, the commercial capital, rose by 19% in the year through February due to a surge in foreign demand and speculative buying. The central bank is wary of pockets of potential stress, as the ratio of housing debt to disposable income has climbed to nearly 190%.Economists say stark growth divides are also emerging across the country. The disparity is evident even in some cities, where inner city residents are benefiting from surging house prices while former manufacturing hubs on the fringes have been hollowed out.Many Australian households are yet to see any benefit from an improving economy: real household disposable income fell by 0.2% in the quarter, while wage incomes contracted by 0.5%. So far, many people have dealt with low wage growth by dipping into their savings rather than curbing spending pending\u2014a behavior economists say is most evident in the mining states.\u201cWe\u2019re working but just keeping our head above water. It just feels tougher than it\u2019s ever been here,\u201d said Samantha Hopkinson, pushing a stroller at a shopping mall in suburban Perth, an area hard hit by the end of the mining boom. \u201cThe prices of everything keeps going up. A few years ago, when the boom was on, everyone could deal with it. Now everyone is struggling, losing jobs.\u201d\u2014Rob Taylor in Canberra and James Glynn in Sydney contributed to this article.Write to Rachel Pannett at rachel.pannett@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T04:07:00.000Z", "title": "Australia avoids recession, keeping long winning streak going", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582650511137082568"}, {"author": "Louise Radnofsky and Laura Meckler", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/president-trump-seeks-immigration-overhaul-signals-hes-open-to-compromise-1488337872", "tags": ["amnesty", "deportation", "donald trump", "illegal immigrants", "immigration compromise", "undocumented immigrants", "political", "general news", "crime", "legal action", "international relations", "illegal immigration", "migration", "politics", "domestic politics", "government bodies", "executive branch", "elections", "national", "presidential elections"], "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Donald Trump said privately Tuesday he wants to see a broad immigration overhaul that addresses the status of people living in the U.S. illegally, and in a speech to Congress he held out the idea of a bipartisan compromise.\u201cIf we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades,\u201d he said Tuesday evening in his prime-time address to lawmakers.But he gave no details, nor did he mention any of the elements of immigration policy favored by Democrats. Much of the rest of his speech was focused on increased enforcement of existing laws.During a lunch with TV network anchors on Tuesday, Mr. Trump voiced support for a compromise immigration overhaul, sparking speculation about the president\u2019s goals after a campaign and early policy directives built on strict immigration enforcement and a repeated insistence on a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.White House Proposes Cutting State Department Budget 37%The Trump administration is proposing to cut spending by 37% for the State Department and its foreign-aid division.Click to Read StoryTrump Looks to Jump-Start Momentum on Key InitiativesPresident Trump, in an address to Congress on Tuesday, will look to jump-start momentum on top White House and congressional initiatives, including enacting a new health-insurance system and overhauling the tax code.Click to Read StoryTrump to Sign Bills Repealing Obama-Era Regulations on Firearms, WaterPresident Trump\u00a0is set to sign bills repealing Obama-era regulations on water and firearm purchases by some people with mental-health issues, as well as a bill affecting an initiative to asset historically black colleges.Click to Read StoryAdvertisementSenate Confirms Wilbur Ross as Commerce SecretaryThe Senate confirmed Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary Monday, an appointment key to allowing President Donald Trump to make progress on his campaign promise to overhaul U.S. trade policy.Click to Read StoryJustice Department to Ease Up on Probes of Police DepartmentsAttorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department will likely pull back from the investigations into alleged abuses at municipal police departments.Click to Read StoryTrump Vows to Press Ahead With Rewrite of Obamacare, Despite Political RisksPresident Donald Trump, heading into a critical stretch of Republicans\u2019 push to rewrite the Affordable Care Act, acknowledged Monday the effort would be complex and politically risky, but said he is determined to forge ahead because the ACA is a \u201cdisaster.\u201dClick to Read StoryAdvertisementTRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYSAfter the lunch, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said the president was \u201copen to having conversations\u201d about how to repair a broken immigration system and he believed the system was in need of \u201cmassive reform.\u201dThose conversations would have to include discussion of a legalized status for people currently in the country, as well as issues such as deportation policies and work authorizations, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday night. The president didn\u2019t have a position on the issues and wasn\u2019t advocating for them in the reported remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Spicer said.Mr. Trump made clear over the lunch that he wouldn\u2019t support a pathway to citizenship, a senior White House official said.Legal status for undocumented immigrants is backed by virtually all Democrats in Congress, who generally support offering those who qualify a path to citizenship as well as legalization. Many Republicans oppose legal status of any kind for those in the U.S. illegally, calling it amnesty that rewards lawbreaking, but some have expressed interest in a compromise position that stops short of citizenship.Even the suggestion of openness to an immigration compromise is extraordinary, however, from a president whose candidacy was fueled by forceful denunciations of illegal immigration that resonated with voters receptive to his message that unlawful residents were responsible for everything from a struggling economy to violent crime. That message contributed in no small measure to the early success of Mr. Trump\u2019s unlikely campaign, and calls to build the wall were a feature of his rallies.As president, Mr. Trump has ordered a crackdown on immigration, including stepped-up deportations, tougher border security and new restrictions on travel to the U.S. Some of his top advisers, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and policy aide Stephen Miller, are longtime and leading opponents of liberalized immigration policy.During his speech to Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump also sounded a tough line on immigration. \u201cBy finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want all Americans to succeed\u2014but that can\u2019t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.\u201dBut this isn\u2019t the first time Mr. Trump has privately expressed support for a more liberal immigration policy. At a lunch with a bipartisan group of senators several weeks ago, Mr. Trump said he is open to the sort of comprehensive overhaul passed by the Senate in 2013, which included a path to citizenship for most of the 11 million people living here illegally, according to one senator who was there and several others familiar with the meeting.At the time of the lunch with the senators, the White House disputed that characterization and said Mr. Trump was only voicing general support for addressing the issue.The 2013 bill died in the GOP-run House, and since then such ideas have largely been shunned by Republican candidates and officeholders.Few have expected any move toward bipartisanship on illegal immigration, and there has been virtually no talk in Congress about trying again to pass a major piece of legislation on the issue.\u2014Michael C.

The framework is a signal to lawmakers, businesses and trading partners about how the administration plans to carry out its policies. Several business leaders and congressional aides were briefed on the trade-policy blueprint and are aware of the draft document\u2019s contents.In the face of Republican concerns, a congressional aide said language in the draft challenging the WTO could still be toned down in a final, public version.The policy mainly spelled out a broad approach to dealing with trading partners\u2014including China, South Korea and Mexico, where the U.S. has trade deficits\u2014and the global trading system as a whole, via the Geneva-based WTO.The outcome of two important test cases at the WTO could help determine the Trump administration\u2019s attitude toward the international trading system, trade lawyers say.The first is a challenge China brought when the U.S. failed to grant the country \u201cmarket economy\u201d status in December on the 15th anniversary of the country\u2019s membership in the WTO. By not granting Beijing that status, the U.S. can continue calculating punitive tariffs on allegedly dumped Chinese goods in ways that are often disadvantageous to Chinese companies.The second is a case the Obama administration brought that challenges China\u2019s subsidies for aluminum production. The WTO has only limited rules to prevent subsidies, and a ruling for China in that case could lead the Trump administration to look for other measures to challenge Chinese subsidies.\u201cAmericans are subject only to U.S. law not to WTO decisions,\u201d the draft document reads. \u201cThe Trump administration will aggressively defend American sovereignty over matters of trade policy.\u201dThe draft document outlines the legal argument for rejecting WTO dispute-settlement decisions. Some economists and lawmakers fear that failure of the U.S. to abide by WTO decisions or unilateral action by the U.S. not compliant with international law will trigger retaliation by other countries. The risk is that such an approach, if copied by other countries, could weaken adherence to the WTO\u2019s rule-based system around the globe and upend seven decades of increasing U.S.-led cooperation on trade since World War II.The WTO sometimes interprets trade agreements in a way that hamstrings the ability of the U.S. to respond effectively to unfair trade practices under WTO rules, the administration said in the document.\u201cThose activist interpretations, untethered from economic realities, undermine confidence in the trading system,\u201d the document said. The administration \u201cwill act aggressively as needed to discourage this type of behavior.\u201dOne trade lawyer who has been briefed by the administration said while the principles may appear more aggressive on paper that past administrations, the true test is how the administration applies the agenda in practice. \u201cIt\u2019s red meat for the public, but the question is, how do they actually execute it?\u201dBeijing is singled out in the document, which pointed to China\u2019s entry into the WTO in 2001 as when U.S. trade policy went awry. The Asian powerhouse\u2014now the No. 2 economy in the world\u2014has been targeted as representing many of the administration\u2019s worst trade-practice complaints. Mr. Trump and his trade lieutenants have lambasted Beijing for using a depreciated exchange rate to gain a competitive advantage, subsidizing industries, including through state-owned firms, inadequately protecting against theft of intellectual-property rights and using a host of nontariff trade barriers to block access to international firms.One key principle the administration said it plans to apply is a form of trade quid pro quo called \u201creciprocity\u201d to countries that refuse to open up their markets. Lawmakers and the Trump administration are considering toughening up national-security reviews of foreign investments into the U.S. to leverage better trade terms with China. If Beijing doesn\u2019t open up its markets to U.S. investors or exports, for example, the administration could use its powers to block Chinese deals to buy U.S. assets, or threaten higher tariffs on Chinese imports.\u201cThis is a completely new challenge of the WTO, existentially questioning whether we should be part of the WTO,\u201d said a senior congressional aide who reviewed the document. \u201cPrevious administrations never called that into question.\u201dThe administration says it intends to update the document when Congress confirms a U.S. trade representative. Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick, is widely expected to win confirmation but is facing questions about decades-old work representing foreign governments.Parts of the policy document contain arguments similar to those in a widely circulated memorandum Mr. Lighthizer wrote in 2010. At the time, Mr. Lighthizer told a congressionally mandated China commission that the U.S. could put its WTO commitments on hold, restricting imports from China until the country changes its behavior in key areas.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com and William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T03:22:00.000Z", "title": "Trump trade policy expected to seek smaller WTO role in the U.S.", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582650431405563746"}, {"author": "Tim Hanrahan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2017/02/28/prepared-text-of-donald-trumps-speech-to-congress/", "tags": ["Congress", "Crime", "Donald Trump", "Immigration", "Speech"], "content": "President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress in a prime-time speech Tuesday night in which he said he will look to jump-start momentum on his top initiatives. Here is the full text of his prepared speech.* * *PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP\u2019S ADDRESS TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS\nRemarks as prepared for deliveryTO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation\u2019s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\u2019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice \u2013- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.All the nations of the world \u2014 friend or foe \u2014 will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding \u2014 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.For too long, we\u2019ve watched our middle class shrink as we\u2019ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.We\u2019ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit \u2014 and so many other places throughout our land.We\u2019ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross \u2014 and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.And we\u2019ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -\u2013 families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus \u2014 as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake \u2013 and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first \u2026 because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.\nOur military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.\nAbove all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.It\u2019s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I\u2019ve made in keeping those promises.Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We\u2019ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials \u2013- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job\u2011crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines \u2014 thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs \u2014 and I\u2019ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.\nI have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth \u2014 and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed \u2013- but that can\u2019t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -\u2013 from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.\nWe cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America \u2014 we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe \u2014 and to keep out those who would do us harm.As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS \u2014 a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court \u2014 from my list of 20 judges \u2014 who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.\nNinety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.\nWe\u2019ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we\u2019ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy \u2014 making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes \u2014 but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it\u2019s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me \u2014 without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it \u2014 that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.They weren\u2019t even asking for change. But I am.I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the \u201cabandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.\u201dLincoln was right \u2014 and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others \u2013- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America\u2019s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages, and help struggling families \u2013- including immigrant families \u2013- enter the middle class.I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security, and to restore respect for our laws.If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program \u2013- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country \u2013- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States \u2014 financed through both public and private capital \u2013- creating millions of new jobs.\nThis effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State \u2014 it is unsustainable and collapsing.One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges \u2013- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?We now know that all of those promises have been broken.Obamacare is collapsing \u2013- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice \u2013- it is a necessity.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts \u2013- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance \u2013 and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines \u2013- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.\nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.Our citizens deserve this, and so much more \u2013- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things,Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed withPompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.\nOn receiving this news, Megan\u2019s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\u2019s life. Today she is 20 years old \u2014 and a sophomore at Notre Dame.Megan\u2019s story is about the unbounded power of a father\u2019s love for a daughter.But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need.If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \u2013- and the souls \u2013- of every American child.Education is the civil rights issue of our time.I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth,including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone \u2013- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\nThis is not acceptable in our society.Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.But to create this future, we must work with \u2013- not against -\u2013 the men and women of law enforcement.We must build bridges of cooperation and trust \u2013- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters \u2013 and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they\u2019ll come home safe and sound.We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.And we must support the victims of crime.I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE \u2013- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.Jamiel\u2019s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands \u2013- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \u2013- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know \u2013- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and \u2013- if they must \u2013- to fight and to win.I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.Our veterans have delivered for this Nation \u2013- and now we must deliver for them.The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero \u2013- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \u201cRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\u201d Ryan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom \u2013- we will never forget him.To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.But our partners must meet their financial obligations.And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific \u2013- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people \u2013- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict \u2014 not more.\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past \u2013- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\u2019s centennial. At that celebration, the country\u2019s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.Imagine the wonders our country could know in America\u2019s 250th year.Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.And streets where mothers are safe from fear \u2014 schools where children learn in peace \u2014 and jobs where Americans prosper and grow \u2014 are not too much to ask.When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.This is our vision. This is our mission.But we can only get there together.We are one people, with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood.We all salute the same flag.And we are all made by the same God.And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears \u2013-\ninspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past \u2013-\nand guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and \u2013Believe in yourselves.Believe in your future.And believe, once more, in America.Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.THE WHITE HOUSE,\nFebruary 28, 2017.", "date": "2017-03-01T02:28:28-05:00", "title": "Prepared Text of Donald Trump\u2019s Speech to Congress", "id": "BL-WB-67689"}, {"author": "Andrew Browne", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-gloats-as-trump-squanders-u-s-soft-power-1488278788", "tags": ["china's world", "china-asean", "china trade", "china trade liberalization", "china-u.s. relations", "freedom of the press", "gaggle", "hun sen", "one belt one road", "soft power", "trump", "u.s.-china relations", "white house press ban", "Xi Jinping", "Donald Trump", "media", "entertainment"], "content": "SHANGHAI\u2014When the White House barred reporters from several media organizations, including the New York Times and CNN, from a briefing last week, Xinhua News Agency issued an urgent bulletin.China is often excoriated in the West for its harsh treatment of the media: It ranks almost at the bottom of the World Press Freedom Index, a notch above Syria.So, to Chinese propagandists, the widely criticized White House move was a cause for glee\u2014and another example of Donald Trump playing into China\u2019s hands.For almost seven decades, the U.S. has championed a liberal order in the Asia-Pacific\u2014free trade, open borders and open societies. The system has scored some of its greatest triumphs in the region; from South Korea to Indonesia, growing prosperity begat democracy that, in turn, helped to secure an enduring peace.Today, America\u2019s ideological shift, part of a populist backlash to globalization, threatens to undermine Washington\u2019s position in a region it transformed.To the extent that the Trump White House closes the country\u2019s borders to immigrants, raises the specter of trade tariffs or impedes the operations of a free press\u2014even when those restrictions have no equivalence in the repression that Chinese journalists suffer\u2014it creates an opportunity for Beijing.This is a soft-power battle. For China, the prize is greater influence\u2014in time, pre-eminence\u2014in Asia, and Mr. Trump is a godsend.Increasingly, the image makers around Chinese President Xi Jinping are defining him in contrast to his U.S. counterpart: an optimist where Mr. Trump takes a dark view of the U.S. and its place in the world; an internationalist to his \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism.Mr. Xi speaks of an Asian \u201ccommunity of common destiny,\u201d and he backs the slogan with generous infusions of cash.His signature project, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, is to provide trading infrastructure across the Eurasian landmass, as well as maritime routes to Europe\u2014ports, energy pipelines, electricity grids and telecommunications networks.China is building connectivity with its neighbors; Mr. Trump wants to erect a Mexican border wall.The Nation, a Thai newspaper, said the White House attempt to restrict immigration from seven mainly-Muslim countries heralded \u201can era of unprecedented, globe-sweeping intolerance,\u201d with potential consequences for Southeast Asia, a region that encompasses Indonesia and Malaysia, two Muslim-majority nations.A sharply worded editorial in the paper warned that the new U.S. president would \u201cmake America ugly again.\u201dApart from Japan, which feels most threatened by China\u2019s rise and has gone all out to court the new White House, the most enthusiastic support has come from the region\u2019s authoritarians, who calculate that Mr. Trump won\u2019t push democracy or lecture them about media freedoms and other civil liberties.Cambodian strongman Hun Sen this week invoked the White House press restriction in arguing for a tougher line against media \u201canarchy,\u201d and suggested the move should silence his own critics. \u201cThey do not condemn Trump as a dictator. Ah! Or is it true, the United States has a dictator? Please make clear on this,\u201d the Phnom Penh Post quoted him as saying in a speech to mark National Clean City Day.In much of the rest of Asia, the notion of American exceptionalism is fraying.Even before Mr. Trump took office, U.S. friends and allies were playing Washington against Beijing, extracting what they could from both sides while trying to avoid getting entangled in their strategic rivalry.The prime exponent of this diplomacy is Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who in the final months of the Obama presidency solemnly declared, on a visit to Beijing, that it was time to \u201csay goodbye\u201d to America. He was promptly rewarded with promises of Chinese loans and investment worth $24 billion.In reality, says Chito Sta. Romana, Manila\u2019s incoming ambassador to Beijing, the Philippine president doesn\u2019t intend to cast aside his country\u2019s main security backer. Rather, he is trying to navigate between the two great powers to \u201cmaximize gains.\u201dFor Washington, rather than a sudden parting of the ways, this could become a drawn-out estrangement.So far, no other country has shifted as dramatically toward China as the Philippines. But America\u2019s Asian partners are growing more distant as they weigh the benefits of security cooperation with the U.S. against the economic advantages that flow from China.Thailand is drifting away. So is Malaysia. South Korea, home to some 28,500 U.S. troops, agonizes over whether it can afford to offend China by installing a U.S. missile-defense system against North Korea that Beijing sees a threat to its own security.In Australia, Mr. Trump\u2019s tetchy phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has intensified a debate over how to strike a balance between loyalty to the U.S. and commitment to a Chinese trading partner that takes the lion\u2019s share of its iron-ore exports, while filling its universities with fee-paying students.Gradually, China is finding itself in a position to fill a vacuum in its neighborhood as American traditional values recede.Geoff Raby, a former Australian ambassador to Beijing, argues that Mr. Trump is tipping the regional balance further in China\u2019s favor. Mr. Xi, he says, \u201cis like the cat that\u2019s got the cream.\u201dWrite to Andrew Browne at andrew.browne@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T02:07:00.000Z", "title": "China gloats as Trump squanders some moral high ground in Asia", "id": "SB11179794870698604817404582649101442957684"}, {"author": "Tim Hanrahan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2017/02/28/excerpts-from-president-trumps-speech-to-congress/", "tags": ["Congress", "Donald Trump", "Speech"], "content": "Ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0speech to Congress on Tuesday night, the White House released excerpts of his prepared text.

Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday said retaining a surcharge on the state\u2019s highest earners is a sticking point as budget talks with the state Legislature heat up.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed in January to renew the so-called millionaire\u2019s tax\u2014an 8.82% levy on household income above $2 million and individual filers\u2019 income above $1 million. He said without the tax there would be a hole in the spending plan.Referring to opponents of the tax, the governor said: \u201cWe just went through an election and we know the middle class is in pain and needs help, and they want to argue for a millionaire\u2019s tax cut instead of middle-class tax cut? I don\u2019t understand any tenet of that.\u201dThe governor didn\u2019t appear eager to raise the tax on high earners any higher, a plan Democrats in the state Assembly have put forward. Asked about their proposal to put a 10% levy on those earning more than $100 million, he pointed to the GOP-led Senate\u2019s position: \u201cForget an increase,\u201d he said, \u201cthey won\u2019t do an extension of the current tax.\u201dMr. Cuomo made the remarks during his first formal news conference at the state Capitol since the 2017 legislative session began in January.The state\u2019s roughly $152 billion budget is due April 1, giving Mr. Cuomo, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan and Democratic Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie several weeks to work out the tax.A spokesman for Mr. Flanagan, Scott Reif, responded to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s remarks Tuesday, saying: \u201cAbove all else, Senate Republicans are focused on making New York more affordable for hard-working, middle-class families. We support cutting taxes, not raising them.\u201dMr. Heastie\u2019s spokesman, Mike Whyland, stood by the plan to raise taxes further on high earners: \u201cAssembly Democrats have a progressive plan that calls for millionaires and multimillionaires to pay a little more so New York can fully fund our commitments,\u201d he said.This year\u2019s budget talks have been overshadowed by the first few weeks of a new presidency. Republican President Donald Trump has put forth a number of proposals that could affect the state\u2019s receipts, including a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In response, the governor said his office has been \u201cthinking about scenarios that would give us the flexibility to respond,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t yet have a contingency plan in place.\u00a0\u201cWhat is \u2018Plan B\u2019 to events you can\u2019t even conceive?\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a whole continuum of proposals.\u201dThe governor didn\u2019t dine with Mr. Trump at the White House this week during an annual dinner between the president and state governors and said he hasn\u2019t spoken with the new president since he took office. But unlike some of his fellow Democrats, Mr. Cuomo declined on Tuesday to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s nascent presidency. \u201cI\u2019ll let the American people decide what their opinion is,\u201d he said.Write to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com", "date": "2017-03-01T01:31:00.000Z", "title": "Millionaire\u2019s tax at issue in New York state budget talks ", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582650291419448130"}, {"author": "Kate King", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jersey-governor-taps-surplus-for-addiction-treatment-1488318271", "tags": ["new jersey budget", "new jersey politics", "Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey", "Chris Christie", "financial performance", "earnings", "corporate", "industrial news", "economic performance", "indicators", "budget account", "government finance", "government budget", "taxation", "sub-national", "local budget", "economic news", "political", "general news", "education", "politics", "international relations", "domestic politics", "regional politics", "school", "elections", "national", "presidential elections", "insurance", "non-life insurance", "health", "medical insurance", "financial services", "health maintenance organizations", "private health insurance"], "content": "TRENTON\u2014In his final budget address as governor of New Jersey, Republican Chris Christie touted his administration\u2019s economic record, challenged lawmakers to revamp the state\u2019s school funding formula and outlined proposals to boost funding for addiction treatment and public pension payments.Mr. Christie\u2019s proposed budget keeps spending low and avoided a showdown with the Democratic-controlled legislature over the state\u2019s school funding formula. Instead he asked lawmakers to negotiate with him a revised formula within 100 days.Democratic lawmakers, who have butted heads with the governor on school funding and public pension issues, said they were relieved that his final budget proposal appeared to be \u201cnot confrontational.\u201d\u201cWe have always wanted to get things done here,\u201d said state Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat. \u201cThis state has the most powerful governor in the nation. No matter what your poll numbers are, you\u2019re still the governor until you\u2019ve left.\u201dPolls have pegged Mr. Christie\u2019s job approval rating at less than 20% as he approaches the end of his second and final term as governor. Re-elected by a wide margin in 2013, the governor\u2019s popularity was battered by the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal and residents\u2019 displeasure with his frequent travels out of state as he campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination.After dropping out of the GOP race, Mr. Christie quickly endorsed then-candidate Donald Trump, and many believed the presidential election signaled a Washington job for the New Jersey governor. But Mr. Christie has said with increasingly firmness that he intends to stay in Trenton through the end of his term in January 2018.Democrats said Tuesday that they are eager to work with the governor over the next year but were skeptical of several of his budget proposals including a plan by the governor to boost public pension funding by tapping the state\u2019s lottery revenue. The governor said his proposal would greatly reduce the state\u2019s unfunded public pension liability by injecting lottery revenue into the system.But state lawmakers said a significant amount of New Jersey\u2019s lottery revenue is already dedicated for education and human services programs. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, a Democrat, said the proposal seemed to be \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201dMr. Christie, who has made battling the state\u2019s substance abuse epidemic the cornerstone of his final year in office, also called Tuesday for a new fund to provide addiction treatment and rehabilitation for the state\u2019s poor. The governor said the fund would be paid for with the \u201cabundant surplus\u201d of Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, a not-for-profit entity and the state\u2019s largest insurer.\u201cThis is a public health crisis which is killing our citizens at an alarming rate,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cThese funds could be used to provide the most vulnerable with access to treatment and hope for an even healthier future.\u201dMr. Christie didn\u2019t provide specifics on how this funding would work and was met with laughs from the audience when he said he was \u201cconfident that Horizon will embrace this opportunity.\u201d The insurer released a statement opposing the governor\u2019s proposal, saying it doesn\u2019t have a large surplus and that \u201craiding the reserves that protect the families we insure, including our Medicaid members, will only make insurance more expensive and less secure.\u201dMr. Christie, who campaigned on his credentials as a former federal prosecutor, pledged to address property taxes and the state\u2019s fiscal crisis after he defeated Democratic incumbent Gov. Jon Corzine in the 2009 election. New Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate was 9.8% at the time of his election and has since fallen to 4.7%.\u201cNew Jersey has come back and our economy is consistently growing once again,\u201d Mr. Christie said.The governor\u2019s budget anticipates a 3.6% increase in total revenue compared with this fiscal year, a projection Treasurer Ford Scudder said was reasonable given the state\u2019s low unemployment rate and an overall upward trend in wages and salaries. State officials are also projecting a 1.7% increase in sales tax revenue despite a recent cut to the state-sales tax, which will drop to 6.625% from 7% by January 2018.\u201cWe had pretty strong growth in sales tax last year,\u201d Mr. Scudder said. State officials factored recent upticks in federal interest rates, inflation and consumer spending into the sales-tax revenue estimate, he said.The governor\u2019s $35.5 billion budget includes a $2.5 billion payment to the state pension system, representing a $647 million increase over this fiscal year but about half of the actuarially determined contribution. The budget proposal keeps aid for operating New Jersey school districts flat for the 2018 fiscal year at nearly $9.2 billion.The state didn\u2019t budget for possible changes in federal funding under President Trump\u2019s administration. Mr. Trump has called for increased federal transportation and infrastructure spending as well as a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWe\u2019re not anticipating increased revenue or reduction in appropriations due to a massive federal transportation program,\u201d Mr. Scudder said in a briefing to reporters ahead of the governor\u2019s address. \u201cAll we can due is budget off current law and update as things change.\u201d\u2014Leslie Brody contributed to this article.Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T00:54:00.000Z", "title": "In final budget speech, Gov.

That question has once again acquired force in Washington. In recent years congressional Republicans have pushed for such a designation, but the Obama administration always stood in the way. Now, with the Trump administration appearing to move toward a designation, both sides are airing their arguments.Supporters of the idea insist that the Muslim Brotherhood has helped incubate terrorist ideologies and encouraged violence. Moreover, the Brotherhood has already been designated as a terrorist group by several American allies, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Opponents counter that a terrorist designation from Washington would do more harm than good. They argue it would empower Islamic State by pushing into their corner those sympathetic to the Brotherhood. It could undermine U.S. relations with several countries where Brotherhood-affiliated parties are in power, such as Morocco and Tunisia. It could potentially be used against certain Muslim American organizations that are accused of having ties to the Brotherhood.What\u2019s striking is how little this debate has changed since 2001, specifically when it comes to the Egyptian mother organization. One side sees the Brotherhood as a complex international conspiracy that is slowly infiltrating America. The other side sees a moderate Islamic group that has embraced democracy and renounced violence. Neither of these views reflects the truth, which is that the old Muslim Brotherhood no longer exists, having splintered after its fall from power in 2013.When the Mubarak regime collapsed in 2011, the Brotherhood achieved its goal of reaching power. But it lost control of the country two years later in a military coup that eventually installed Egypt\u2019s current president, Abdel Fattah Al Sisi. For the Brotherhood, a hierarchical organization that prides itself on discipline, the coup came as a shock. So did the new regime\u2019s severe crackdown against the Brotherhood in the summer of 2013. As its leaders were arrested, went into hiding or escaped abroad, the group faced two immediate challenges: creating a new leadership structure and developing a strategy to topple the Sisi regime.In early 2014, new leadership bodies were elected in Egypt and in Turkey, which had become the hub of Brotherhood activity. Key among them was Mohamed Kamal, a veteran leader of the group\u2019s Guidance Office who had survived the crackdown. As the protests that the Brotherhood had hoped would undermine the coup began to fizzle, its activity intensified.Already so-called deterrence committees had been created from physically fit brothers to protect their demonstrations or engage in street fights with the police. Small firearms and Molotov cocktails started appearing during clashes with authorities. By early 2014, Kamal and some of his comrades had given the green light to violence within limited parameters, calling \u201cspecial committees\u201d to target state infrastructure with bombs and arson. A slogan soon became popular in Brotherhood circles: \u201cAll that is below bullets is nonviolent.\u201dBut if the first wave of violence was in theory limited to infrastructure\u2014with a few police officers targeted nonetheless\u2014the second wave was not. In late 2014 and early 2015, groups began to emerge under the Popular Resistance Movement or the banner of Revolutionary Punishment. Turkish-based Brotherhood television channels cheered the murder of police deemed responsible for killing Brotherhood members.Theologians drew up justifications for these operations. Pro-Brotherhood scholars released a book, \u201cThe Jurisprudence of Popular Resistance to the Coup,\u201d that outlined an explicit ideological basis for violence within the framework of the Brotherhood\u2019s ideology. It argued that targeting security forces and government officials was a form of self-defense.The Brotherhood was also undergoing a major internal civil war, pitting the Kamal faction against the more pragmatic and cautious old guard. The division, which came into the open in May of 2015, was followed by a decline in violent attacks, likely as a result of the old guard cutting off funds it controlled.The lull proved temporary. A third and more sophisticated wave of violence hit Egypt in the summer of 2016 as newer groups under the names Hassm (Decisiveness) and Liwaa al-Thawra (Revolution\u2019s Brigade) emerged. These operations were no longer limited to police assassinations; they included car bombs and ambushes at security checkpoints. As the internal Brotherhood strife continued, Egyptian state security forces killed Mohamed Kamal in October 2016. The power struggle continues today, with neither side accepting the other\u2019s legitimacy.The old Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood is disintegrating. In its place stand two competing leaderships, along with spinoff groups engaged in terrorism. This collapse should not be surprising. The Brotherhood was all but eradicated by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and \u201960s. Had it not been for an Islamist revival across Egyptian universities in the 1970s, the Brotherhood would have been history.The Trump administration should note these developments. Designating the entire Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as a terrorist organization wouldn\u2019t reflect today\u2019s realities\u2014to say nothing of a blanket designation against all Brotherhood-affiliated groups in the world. Instead the administration should target specific individuals, factions and spinoff groups that have been involved in terrorist activity. Then the administration can move to the larger and more critical question: how to tackle comprehensively the overall Islamist ideology.Mr. Awad is a research fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism.

That a handful of advisers did business in Russia is amazing only because it\u2019s so few. In July 2009, President Obama himself visited Moscow with a passel of U.S. execs in tow. Joe Biden was in Moscow a few months later partly for business-promotion purposes.Go back and read the press. In 1995, Al Gore, presiding over the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, helped enable  Exxon\u2019s Sakhalin Island venture. Sixteen years later, the Obama White House helped enable its Russian Arctic venture. These two deals define almost the entirety of Rex Tillerson\u2019s CV in Russia.But wasn\u2019t Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s sometime campaign adviser, an adviser to Viktor Yanukovych, Vladimir Putin\u2019s favorite in Ukraine\u2019s 2010 presidential election? At the time, Mr. Yanukovych was promoting an economic tie-up with the European Union, a near-and-dear U.S. interest. Mr. Manafort may not have been working for the Obama administration\u2019s preferred Ukrainian pol, but he was following in the footsteps of previous U.S. political aides, including some dispatched by Bill Clinton to save Boris Yeltsin\u2019s re-election in 1996 (enabling Mr. Yeltsin eventually to hand power to Mr. Putin to protect his entourage\u2019s stolen wealth).Only later, when Mr. Putin yanked Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s chain, did the events unfold that now have Democrats eager to discern nefarious patterns.What about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to \u201cshadowy\u201d Russia banker Carter Page? A hilarious and lengthy article at Politico.com finds Mr. Page an elusive wannabe who held a minor job in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office.What about Roger Stone, the make-believe secret shaman of American politics? Mr. Stone wants you to believe he\u2019s connected to the KGB.In the Trump-as-mole screeds, the biggest wonder is the non-mention of  Goldman Sachs. After all, Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin both worked there when Goldman, on the eve of Russia\u2019s 1998 default, arranged a convenient bond sale to tide the Yeltsin government over. Then again, another Goldman alum, Robert Rubin, was running the Clinton Treasury at the time, and pitched in with an IMF bailout for Russia.We come to the sorry truth: So much hopeful money that poured into Russia only helped fund the emergence of the Putin kleptocracy. Over the course of three administrations, when the U.S. goal was to promote business ties with Russia, Mr. Trump was notable mainly for failing to find a seat on the train. His Russian-backed property and branding deals all came a cropper. He did manage to hold his Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013. Unlike Formula One, however, he hasn\u2019t been back since. At least, like all high-end New York real-estate developers, he couldn\u2019t fail to profit from selling overpriced condos to Russian emigres.\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and actions as president bear more than a passing resemblance to those of Mr. Putin during his first years consolidating power,\u201d writes veteran foreign correspondent Susan B. Glasser in a  New York Times op-ed last week. \u201cThe similarities are striking enough that they should not be easily dismissed.\u201dThe similarities are indeed striking. Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump both have arms and legs. When it comes to distinguishing noise from signal, however, two men could not be less alike.Russia was a country in chaos. Its president was a drunk seeking a successor to protect his daughter and friends from corruption investigations. Mr. Putin, a former KGB agent and head of the secret police, ran one of the few, after a fashion, functioning institutions in Russia, albeit arm in arm with organized crime.Mr. Trump\u2019s rise couldn\u2019t be more different. He\u2019s a reality TV star and brand manager. To an unusual degree, he\u2019s a president who lacks even a party. Meanwhile, the courts, the bureaucracy, the media, the political parties all continue to function as they always have.By all means, investigate Russia\u2019s propaganda efforts directed toward influencing the U.S. election, as long as we don\u2019t kid ourselves unduly that something novel and unprecedented took place. As for Mr. Trump, even to a broken-down Russian intelligence he simply would not have been that interesting a person until very recently. Now, somehow, he\u2019s got the power of the U.S. president if he can figure out how to use it (a big if).His increased military spending plus his support for U.S. energy, ironically, would amount to harsher sanctions on Russia than any Mr. Obama imposed. In a second irony, his rise has half the U.S. political firmament, Democrats plus a smattering of Never Trump Republicans, willing to see the Putin regime for what it is. Thinking clearly about Russia might finally become a fashion in Washington.

The Bluegrass State is considering a bill that could make charters an option for families as early as next year. On Monday, charter-school legislation sponsored by a Democrat passed the Montana House with bipartisan support. \u201cThe Constitution does not guarantee the unions in our schools the right to control them and the money that are there, and that\u2019s the scenario we have today,\u201d said Montana state Rep. Fred Thomas, a Republican supporter of the bill, at a hearing.Even states that already have charter laws are moving to strengthen them. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, recently announced an effort to make charters easier to open, operate and innovate. And courts continue to reject attempts by teachers unions and other charter opponents to thwart the will of parents and keep underprivileged children trapped in low-quality schools run by union members. Last week, Washington state\u2019s charter law survived a court challenge, and the judge\u2019s ruling rejected claims that charter schools are unaccountable and divert funds from traditional public schools.In addition to this charter progress, education reformers see prospects for more private school choice in the form of education savings accounts, or ESAs, which they describe as the next step in school choice. Under an ESA system, money that would otherwise go to funding a child\u2019s public-school education is instead placed into a restricted-use bank account, from which the family can withdraw to spend on a variety of education-related services. Like vouchers, ESAs allow the money to follow the child. But ESAs don\u2019t limit education options in the way that vouchers do. Instead, families can use money in the account for tuition, textbooks, tutoring, test preparation, transportation, Advanced Placement courses, online learning and even college savings accounts.Jason Bedrick, a policy analyst at the research organization EdChoice, told me that along with allowing families to tailor spending to the education needs of their children, ESAs can control costs. \u201cMoving from a coupon or voucher model to a bank-account model helps guard against tuition inflation like we\u2019ve seen in Pell Grants,\u201d he said. With ESAs, \u201cthere\u2019s no price floor. If you\u2019ve got a $5,000 voucher, no school is going to charge less than $5,000. With an ESA, there\u2019s a lot more competition because private schools are not just competing against each other and against public schools but also competing against other sorts of education opportunities.\u201d In other words, a parent with an ESA has the ability to hold both public and private schools accountable.Education savings accounts initially catered to students with special needs, but reformers are now pushing to expand eligibility to everyone. Last week, New Hampshire\u2019s state Senate passed a universal ESA measure, which Georgia, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia are also considering. Less ambitious school-choice expansion is being attempted in Florida and South Carolina. An ESA law passed by Nevada in 2015 was upheld as constitutional, but the courts struck down the program\u2019s funding mechanism. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, is hoping to rectify the situation in his next budget, but that\u2019s more difficult since Democrats took control of Nevada\u2019s state legislature in November.Research shows that school choice is popular with families and most beneficial to the vulnerable students. Education savings accounts are no different. A 2015 EdChoice survey put support for ESAs at 62% among all respondents, 67% among parents of schoolchildren, 69% among city dwellers and 70% among people with annual family incomes below $40,000. The first ESA law passed in Arizona in 2011, and according to the latest federal standardized test scores Arizona has been making more progress in math and reading than any other state.When I asked Matthew Ladner of the Foundation for Excellence in Education how President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos could best assist these reform efforts, he suggested that they use their bully pulpit to let states know they have a friend in Washington.

The  CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, a gauge that measures investors\u2019 expectations for volatility in stocks, has been stuck near multiyear lows.But in a sign that things aren\u2019t as serene as benchmark stock indexes may be indicating, three exchange-traded products that track market volatility climbed last week for six days in a row, before falling for two days and then rebounding on Tuesday. The ETPs have drawn more than $720 million in fresh money this year, FactSet data show, in a sign that some investors are taking measures to protect against violent price swings in stocks.The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note is the most traded of these products that allow wagers on stock volatility. The note, called VXX, jumped 8.3% for the six days through Thursday in its longest winning streak since the days leading up to the U.S. presidential election. But in November, U.S. stocks were slumping in a more typical occurrence in which stock markets move in the opposite direction of volatility expectations.\u201cIt is very unusual for VXX to rise in a stable or rising market,\u201d said Don Dale, managing principal at risk solutions group Derivaguard Advisors. \u201cIt usually happens in either big market selloffs or decent-sized selloffs.\u201dInvestors and options traders said the market had been gearing up for President Donald Trump\u2019s speech to Congress on Tuesday night, in which he was expected to update his plans for tax and health-care policies.Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s derivatives research team in a report last week said investors were underestimating the volatility that could emerge in health-care and retail stocks after Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. The retail sector tends to have high tax rates and might benefit if Mr. Trump is able to lower corporate taxes, but it might also be crimped if the White House puts in place a border-adjusted tax that burdens companies that source heavily overseas.People may also be using U.S. volatility futures to hedge against events such as the French presidential election, Mr. Dale said. Global investors are watching the race because of candidate Marine Le Pen, who has proposed leaving the euro currency bloc.\u201cBy extension, that\u2019s driving VXX higher,\u201d Mr. Dale said.Products like VXX are long volatility by tracking the first and second month futures contracts based on the VIX. The ETPs are notorious for losing money over time because of the cost of selling futures that expire and buying contracts further out in the future.This rebalancing process causes big losses in the ETPs\u2019 share prices. VXX plunged 68% last year. Market watchers say VXX\u2019s streak of gains in February was partly explained by a surge in VIX futures expiring in March and April, coinciding with the French election. The price gains in the March and April futures contracts are outweighing the price \u201cdecay\u201d caused by the rebalancing, they said.The VIX\u2019s cousin in Europe, called VSTOXX, has seen its futures curve veer from the normal shape, reflecting investors\u2019 jitters before the French vote and other elections in Europe this year.Some investors are turning to even riskier VIX-based ETPs\u2014those that give double exposure to daily stock volatility. The VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-term ETN and the  ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF surged 17% in the six days through Thursday. Each fell 94% in 2016. The VIX has jumped 13% so far this week. The Dow fell Tuesday, halting its streak of consecutive records.Some investors said the record-setting run-up in U.S. stocks was bound to cause anxiety, especially given the heightened political uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe.While markets still appear largely complacent, a hint of investor anxiety has crept in, with the traditional relationship between stocks and volatility expectations breaking down in February, said Gerald Lucas, a strategist at UBS Wealth Management. The VIX moved in tandem with the S&P 500 index seven times in February.\u201cAt some point, if the rally continues, people get nervous,\u201d said Dominic Salvino, a designated primary market of the VIX at CBOE. \u201cNow people start to price in some risk because the market went up so far.\u201dWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com", "date": "2017-03-01T00:18:00.000Z", "title": "Three ETPs that track market volatility climbed last week for 6 straight days ", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582648043005816400"}, {"author": "Farnaz Fassihi", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-china-block-u-n-sanctions-over-syria-chemical-weapons-use-1488315139", "tags": ["chemical weapons", "islamic state", "middle east conflict", "syria crisis", "syrian civil war", "united nations general assembly", "trade", "external payments", "economic news", "political", "general news", "national", "public security", "crime", "legal action", "armed forces", "international relations", "international sanctions", "politics", "domestic politics", "risk news", "tariffs", "trade barriers", "military action", "war crimes", "weapons programs"], "content": "UNITED NATIONS\u2014Russia and the U.S. clashed openly at the Security Council over a Syria sanctions resolution, a confrontation signaling Washington and Moscow don\u2019t see eye to eye on some of the world\u2019s top security crises.The U.S. on Tuesday accused Russia of covering for Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons, and Russia accused the U.S. of using false pretenses to impose sanctions to try to topple Syria\u2019s government.The tense exchange mirrored those between Russia and previous U.S. administrations, offering a telling look at deep divisions that remain even as President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, have vowed to improve ties.New U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who arrived in late January, has held close to core American policies when it comes to differences with Russia on Ukraine and Syria. On two previous occasions, in early February and last week, Ms. Haley assailed Russia at the Security Council for what she called its \u201caggressive actions\u201d and \u201cdestabilizing\u201d role in Ukraine.On Tuesday, Ms. Haley went a step further, directly confronting Russia and China over their positions, saying they were taking an indefensible stance by putting the protection of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime ahead of global security.\u201cIt is a sad day on the Security Council when member states start making excuses for other member states killing their own people,\u201d Ms. Haley said. She added the vote signaled to the world that allies of Russia and China would be protected even if they kill their own people.U.S. allies at the U.N. welcomed the comments, having feared that even the smallest U.S. policy shift toward Russia would have significant impact on issues such as Syria, Europe, counterterrorism and Iran.But it further dimmed any likelihood of an early rapprochement between Moscow and Washington. The U.S. on Tuesday also countered a Russian assertion that a summit is being planned between Messrs. Trump and Putin, amid growing questions in Washington about contacts between associates of the president and the Kremlin.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said practical preparations have started for a meeting between the two leaders, but added there was \u201cno agreement yet as to the time and place,\u201d Russian news agencies reported.A senior U.S. official, however, said no preparations are under way.Mr. Trump\u2019s election had raised hopes in Moscow that the U.S. government would move to roll back sanctions imposed after the Russian government annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and gave support to separatists in eastern Ukraine.Mr. Putin said in a congratulatory note he hoped Russia and the U.S. could work as equals following years of strained ties with President Barack Obama\u2019s White House. Mr. Trump\u2014who has long expressed admiration for the Russian leader\u2014enjoyed overwhelmingly positive coverage on Russian state-controlled television.But in recent days, Russian officials have tempered those expectations. Speaking in the resort city of Sochi on Tuesday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the country needed to be prepared for sanctions to continue, the news agency Interfax reported. \u201cWe must prepare for the fact that we will live under sanctions indefinitely.\u201dPro-Kremlin commentators have also moderated their praise of Mr. Trump, as controversy simmers in Washington over Russia policy.House and Senate intelligence committees have begun probes of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, something the Kremlin has routinely denied.Tuesday\u2019s Security Council vote was on a resolution to hold Mr. Assad\u2019s regime accountable for chemical-weapon attacks against civilians. A U.N. investigation asserts Syria used chlorine gas against civilians in at least three proven incidents.The resolution, drafted by France, the U.K. and the U.S., called for sanctions on 11 Syrian individuals and 10 government related entities for their connection to the production and delivery of chemical weapons. It also prohibited all countries from selling weapons or equipment, such as helicopters, that could aid in the delivery of chemical weapons.Nine Council members voted in favor of the resolution, enough for passage, but it was blocked when Russia and China exercised their right as permanent members of the Council to veto the resolution. Bolivia voted against the resolution, and Egypt, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan abstained.Russia said it had voted down the resolution, its seventh veto in five years on Syria, because it was a Western ploy to topple Mr. Assad\u2019s regime and a pretext for sanctions on Syria.Russia\u2019s Deputy U.N. ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, said the statements against China and Russia by Western states were outrageous, adding, \u201cGod will judge you.\u201dChina\u2019s ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said Beijing opposed the resolution because it would threaten peace talks in Geneva and undermine the fragile cease-fire in Syria. He said the U.S. and allies should remember the role they played in allowing the Syrian conflict to deteriorate and said the West\u2019s rhetoric about concern for Syria\u2019s people was \u201ctotal hypocrisy.\u201dThe Security Council resolution resulted from joint investigation by the U.N.\u2019s panel Joint Investigative Mechanism and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OCPW, an international group. The investigation found the Syrian government had deployed chlorine-gas attacks in at least three incidents and that Islamic State had used mustard gas.The Security Council has instituted comprehensive sanctions against Islamic State; Tuesday\u2019s resolution targeted the Syrian regime.Syria has denied the allegations, and its representative to the Council assailed the integrity of the U.N. report.Ms. Haley said the U.S. would impose its own sanctions\u2014including asset freezes and travel bans\u2014on 21 individuals and entities named in the resolution and would work with its European partners to do the same.\u201cThese criminal acts continue today as we speak.

During his appearance last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Bannon offered a profession of faith: \u201cThe center core of what we believe, that we\u2019re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders, but we are a nation with a culture and a reason for being.\u201dAs it happens, I think Mr. Bannon is right about this. In a 2014 conversation with a Vatican-based organization of Catholic conservatives, he presciently declared that there is a \u201cglobal tea party movement.\u201d He described it as \u201cthe working men and women in the world who are just tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos.\u201d Mr. Bannon continued: \u201cThere are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlin than they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado, and they have more of this elite mentality that they\u2019re going to dictate to everybody how the world\u2019s going to be run.\u201dThe members of the global tea party, says Mr. Bannon, reject this idea and believe they know best how to lead their lives. This is why they are pushing back against centralized government wherever they find it, whether in Beijing, Brussels or Washington.These antiglobalist sentiments reveal a deep truth about contemporary politics: Although economic theory may be indifferent to national borders, economic policy cannot be. Economist Branko Milanovic\u2019s famous \u201celephant chart\u201d shows that in recent decades globalization not only has enriched the wealthy everywhere but also has lifted hundreds of millions of people in developing countries out of poverty and\u2014in many cases\u2014into the middle class. Yet substantial portions of the working and middle classes in developed countries have fallen behind.No doubt this has made the world as a whole more prosperous and has helped more people than it has hurt. If the world were a single political unit, economic globalization would survive not only cost-benefit analysis but also a democratic vote.But of course the world is not a single unit. Politicians owe their primary duty to their own citizens. When leaders ask their countrymen to make short-term sacrifices, they must justify their proposals as conducive to the long-term interests of their citizens\u2014not people in other countries. If the Marshall Plan had been presented as a charitable contribution to Europe, Congress probably would have rejected it, and rightly so.We can argue about the policies most likely to promote America\u2019s long-term interests. I doubt that they are Mr. Trump\u2019s\u2014one of the myriad reasons I oppose him. But at the level of principle, the proposition that our leaders should put America first is hard to argue with.In the same vein, I agree with Mr. Bannon that we are a nation with a culture and a reason for being. But we disagree about what this means. Unlike most other countries, our citizens hail from virtually every nation on earth. They share neither ancestry nor race nor ethnicity nor religion. When we speak of American culture in the singular, we cannot be talking about the culture of any particular group. We must mean, instead, the civic culture of principles, institutions and history that we can share\u2014the only culture that can bind us together as one nation. Every form of ethno-nationalism is un-American.America\u2019s reason for being is spelled out in the preamble to the Constitution, the charter of our civic life: to \u201cform a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\u201dI find nothing in these words about a particular religion, or the Judeo-Christian tradition, or a specific canon of the virtues, or social conservatism (or social liberalism, for that matter). It would be interesting to learn whether Mr. Bannon has a different view\u2014he certainly appears to\u2014and if so, on what it rests.I close on a note of agreement. Mr. Bannon believes that contemporary capitalism has lost its moral bearings. He told the Vatican meeting that the question of whether we should \u201cput a cap on wealth creation and distribution\u201d should be \u201cat the heart of every Christian that is a capitalist.\u201d Even more pointedly: \u201cWhat is the purpose of whatever I\u2019m doing with this wealth?\u201dThe invisible hand, Mr. Bannon implies, is not enough to create a moral order. It will be interesting to see how he squares this proposition with his pledge to deconstruct the administrative state.", "date": "2017-03-01T00:17:00.000Z", "title": "Steve Bannon and the \u201cglobal tea party,\u201d writes @BillGalston", "id": "SB11179794870698604817404582648211578442458"}, {"author": "Michael F.

But a new study by Harvard and the University of Texas-Austin finds those rules penalize high-quality coverage for the sick, reward insurers who slash coverage for the sick, and leave patients unable to obtain adequate insurance.The researchers estimate a patient with multiple sclerosis, for example, might file $61,000 in claims. ObamaCare\u2019s rules let MS patients buy coverage for far less, forcing insurers to take a loss on every MS patient. That creates \u201can incentive to avoid enrolling people who are in worse health\u201d by making policies \u201cunattractive to people with expensive health conditions,\u201d the Kaiser Family Foundation explains.To mitigate that perverse incentive, ObamaCare lobs all manner of taxpayer subsidies at insurers. Yet the researchers find insurers still receive just $47,000 in revenue per MS patient\u2014a $14,000 loss per patient.Predictably, that triggers a race to the bottom. Each year, whichever insurer offers the best MS coverage attracts the most MS patients and racks up the most losses. Insurers that offer high-quality coverage either leave the market, as many have, or slash their coverage. Let\u2019s call those losses what they are: penalties for offering high-quality coverage.The result is lower-quality coverage\u2014for MS, rheumatoid arthritis, infertility and other expensive conditions. The researchers find these patients face higher cost-sharing (even for inexpensive drugs), more prior-authorization requirements, more mandatory substitutions, and often no coverage for the drugs they need, so that consumers \u201ccannot be adequately insured.\u201dThe study also corroborates reports that these rules are subjecting patients to higher deductibles and cost-sharing across the board, narrow networks that exclude leading cancer centers, inaccurate provider directories, and opaque cost-sharing. A coalition of 150 patient groups complains this government-fostered race to the bottom \u201ccompletely undermines the goal of the ACA.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this. Employer plans offer drug coverage more comprehensive and sustainable than ObamaCare. The pre-2014 individual market made comprehensive coverage even more secure: High-cost patients were less likely to lose coverage than similar enrollees in employer plans. The individual market created innovative products like \u201cpre-existing conditions insurance\u201d that\u2014for one-fifth the cost of health insurance\u2014gave the uninsured the right to enroll in coverage at healthy-person premiums if they developed expensive conditions.If anything, Republicans should fear not repealing ObamaCare\u2019s pre-existing-conditions rules. The Congressional Budget Office predicts a partial repeal would wipe out the individual market and cause nine million to lose coverage unnecessarily. And contrary to conventional wisdom, the consequences of those rules are wildly unpopular. In a new Cato Institute/YouGov poll, 63% of respondents initially supported ObamaCare\u2019s pre-existing-condition rules. That dropped to 31%\u2014with 60% opposition\u2014when they were told of the impact on quality.Republicans can\u2019t keep their promise to repeal ObamaCare and improve access for the sick without repealing the ACA\u2019s penalties on high-quality coverage.Mr. Cannon is director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute.", "date": "2017-03-01T00:15:00.000Z", "title": "How ObamaCare punishes the sick, from Michael F.

In \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters,\u201d William Cohan, the author of earlier books on Goldman Sachs and Lazard Fr\u00e8res, mounts a defense of Wall Street banking institutions and argues that much of the regulation after 2008 has been counterproductive. In his view, the main culprit in the financial meltdown was Wall Street\u2019s compensation culture, and he presents some controversial proposals to reform it.In the recent election campaign, as Mr. Cohan notes, the Democratic Party platform called for breaking up large Wall Street banks. Even the Republican platform called for separating commercial and investment banks. Since the election, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have lambasted Wall Street and decried the inclusion of so many Wall Street executives in the Trump administration.Mr. Cohan reminds us that populist hostility toward the financial community has a long history. Alexander Hamilton\u2019s plan to have the federal government guarantee the full payment of its debt, thus establishing the unquestioned credit of the United States, was sharply criticized for rewarding evil speculators. Bubbles in asset prices and financial crises have been common in American history; so has rage against financiers. A wagon loaded with dynamite exploded at the corner of Broad and Wall Street in 1920. Franklin Roosevelt savaged Wall Street in his first inaugural address.It is in this context that Mr. Cohan explains the role of finance in the modern economy. The collective institutions that constitute \u201cWall Street,\u201d he notes, provide a \u201cmonumentally important, utterly irreplaceable\u201d service. Indeed, the ability of companies \u201cto get the capital they need from the people who have it and want to invest it is one of the more amazing contraptions that the world has ever constructed.\u201d Companies such as Apple would not exist without Wall Street. The securitization of otherwise illiquid individual mortgages in mortgage-backed securities provides more money for housing and lower mortgage rates. The securitization of auto loans makes financing easier for car buyers. The \u201cjunk bond\u201d market allows businesses without perfect credit to obtain capital. The \u201cdemocratization of capital,\u201d Mr. Cohan writes, \u201chas led to more people in more places across the globe having the chance to pursue their dreams.\u201dBy William D. Cohan  Random House, 154 pages, $25So what went wrong? Where did useful innovation morph into lunacy that almost brought down the whole system? The sea change began in 1969, Mr. Cohan says, when the first investment bank (Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette) sold equity to the public. Previously investment banks were partnerships whose capital came from the net worth of the individual partners, who would assume only the most modest risk since investment failure might endanger their life savings. But once a firm\u2019s capital could be increased by debt and equity financing\u2014in essence, by other people\u2019s money\u2014the calculus shifted.Ultimately all the big banks went public, and a risk-reward system that had encouraged prudence was replaced by a culture of swinging for the fences in the hopes of getting a big annual bonus. When Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went under in 2008, they were allegedly capitalized with more than 30 parts debt to one part equity.What is the solution? Mr. Cohan concedes that some parts of the Obama-era regulations made sense. Excessive leverage had created perverse incentives: All the gain accrued to equity holders, while the losses were taken mainly by debt holders. Requiring banks to have more equity capital, as the regulations did, helped make the system more stable. But reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act\u2014a move that was proposed in 2009 and remains on some legislators\u2019 agendas\u2014makes no sense. The financial crisis, Mr. Cohan observes, \u201chad nothing to do with the fact that there wasn\u2019t a wall separating commercial banking from investment banking.\u201dMr. Cohan argues that much of the regulatory content of the Dodd-Frank law, enacted in 2010, should be dismantled or \u201cjunked\u201d\u2014including the so-called Volcker Rule, which blocks commercial banks from engaging in proprietary trading. Dodd-Frank is indeed overreaching and overcomplicated. The law itself is 2,300 pages, and the rules implementing it take up some 22,000 more. \u201cThe job of nearly one out of every five people working on Wall Street these days,\u201d Mr. Cohan writes, \u201cis to watch what the other four people do all day long.\u201dHe overstates the case, though, when he suggests that bank lending has been severely curtailed and that the \u201cinevitable result\u201d is to doom the economy \u201cto a period of economic stagnation.\u201d In fact, bank credit has grown 23% over the past three years. Nevertheless, borrowing today is needlessly difficult. There is an aversion to even prudent risk-taking, with regulators breathing down lenders\u2019 necks.Mr. Cohan\u2019s solution is to replace Wall Street\u2019s broken compensation system: the bonus culture that creates incentives to take big bets with other people\u2019s money while avoiding accountability when the bets go bad. He says that we need to \u201creturn to a compensation system that more closely resembles that of the partnership culture\u201d of earlier times. Going well beyond calls for a claw-back of bonuses when trouble hits, Mr. Cohan proposes that the leaders of Wall Street firms be required to put their entire net worth on the line. Their co-op apartments, houses in the Hamptons, art collections and bank accounts would all be \u201cfodder for the bank\u2019s creditors\u201d if something goes wrong.Bankers may find this idea even more repugnant than Dodd-Frank and the Volcker Rule. The trick is to produce some less burdensome combination of regulation and a new compensation structure that penalizes bad behavior but allows Wall Street to do what it does best: allocate capital from those who have it to those who need it.Mr. Malkiel, chief investment officer of Wealthfront, is the author of \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street.\u201d", "date": "2017-03-01T00:12:00.000Z", "title": "Dodd-Frank did nothing to fix Wall Street\u2019s broken compensation culture.", "id": "SB11704714165529004070604582632090546229380"}, {"author": "Andrew Tangel", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-koreas-lg-electronics-to-build-u-s-factory-in-tennessee-1488315600", "tags": ["appliances", "bill haslam", "clarksville", "factory", "lg", "lg electronics", "south korea", "tariffs", "tennessee", "tennessee factory", "washing machine factory", "washing machines", "william cho", "LG Electronics", "066570.SE", "capacity", "facilities", "corporate", "industrial news", "facility openings", "computers", "consumer electronics", "personal electronics", "household appliances", "consumer goods", "durable household products", "home electronics", "technology"], "content": "South Korean conglomerate LG Electronics Inc. said it is planning to build a new washing machine factory in Tennessee, its first major U.S. plant, and hire at least 600 workers by the end of 2019.LG\u2019s decision to locate production in the U.S. could aid its push into the American home-appliance market, where it has gained share in recent years competing against rivals such as Michigan-based Whirlpool Corp.A U.S. plant would also help the foreign company avoid U.S. tariffs aimed at its washers produced abroad. For instance, the U.S. Department of Commerce last year imposed tariffs on LG washers made in China, as the company looked for other production bases, including Thailand and Vietnam.William Cho, chief executive of LG\u2019s North America division, said U.S. duties were among the company\u2019s considerations but not the prime motive for building the U.S. factory.While new factory jobs would further U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s goal of boosting American manufacturing, LG\u2019s decision was part of a long-term plan in the works since 2010, Mr. Cho said, adding that a U.S. factory would speed up deliveries to American customers, reducing shipping time and costs, and allow it to more quickly respond to market demands.Mr. Cho said having local facilities and shorter supply chains would generate significant benefits. \u201cIncreased speed to the market makes us more nimble,\u201d he said.LG said it considered locating its U.S. factory in eight states, including ones in the Midwest, but ultimately decided on Tennessee, which offered a grant worth about $20 million for the construction of the 829,000-square foot factory on 310 acres of land near Clarksville, Tenn., according to a person familiar with the matter. LG will lease the land from a local agency and the agreement includes discounted rents and property tax abatement, according to this person.A state spokesman declined to disclose the incentives offered to LG, saying a formal legal agreement wasn\u2019t yet in place.LG\u2019s products have gained traction in the U.S. in recent years. Its share of the U.S. retail washer sales grew to 16.5% in 2016, up from 13.2% in 2012, according to TraQline data compiled by the research firm Stevenson Co.LG billed the highly automated Tennessee factory as \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced production plant for washing machines.\u201d The company previously had a small assembly plant in Alabama in the U.S. about two decades ago.Foreign companies have been opening factories in the U.S. for years. Netherlands-based airplane maker  Airbus Group SE and Japan-based heavy equipment maker  Komatsu Ltd. have U.S. factories in Alabama and Tennessee, respectively.LG isn\u2019t the only appliance manufacturing taking aim at the U.S. market.

Those agencies now receive about $50.1 billion.At the same time, President Donald Trump is developing a federal budget that officials said would add $54 billion to the base defense budget, funded by cuts elsewhere, including the State Department and its foreign-aid division. The addition would increase military spending to more than $600 billion.Lawmakers opposed to the cuts say they will unavoidably devastate the State Department.

Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on state and foreign operations, told reporters Tuesday. He said the proposed budget \u201cdestroys soft power\u201d and puts diplomats at risk.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he didn\u2019t believe that a 37% cut would make it through Congress. \u201cThe diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important and you get results a lot cheaper frequently,\u201d than through military spending, he said.Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said cutting the State Department budget by more than a third would \u201chave serious and detrimental effects on our national-security posture.\u201dThe proposed cuts also drew swift condemnation from aid and advocacy organizations.\u201cA budget that slashes State Department and USAID funding, while further expanding the Pentagon, shows Trump is intent on undermining U.S. government agencies that address pressing human-rights issues, most of which aren't dealt with by military force,\u201d said Sarah Margon, Washington director at Human Rights WatchThe proposed cuts unveiled by the Trump administration this week mark the beginning of a monthslong process within the administration and then with Congress over how to fund the government for the year beginning Oct. 1.Officials at federal agencies will provide input to the Trump administration\u2019s initial proposal ahead of the mid-March release of the White House\u2019s budget blueprint. The White House will build off that document for the release of its full budget, which isn\u2019t expected until May.More than 120 retired three- and four-star generals on Monday sent a letter urging Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress to preserve funding for U.S. diplomatic efforts.The retired military officials cited 2013 testimony from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, then the head of U.S. forces in the Middle East, who told the Armed Services Committee, \u201cIf you don\u2019t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.\u201dThe Bush administration tripled development assistance since 2001, according to an archived version of the State Department\u2019s website.

Yields fall as bond prices rise.The bond market\u2019s stability this year, following a sharp selloff in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election as the U.S. president, is fueling debate over the future of the reflation trades that have driven much trading since Nov. 8.Many investors are now questioning the trades, which consist primarily of buying stocks and selling bonds in expectations that growth and inflation will pick up.Analysts say President Trump\u2019s first formal address to the nation since his inauguration after U.S. markets close on Tuesday could decide the bond market\u2019s next move. Bond yields are likely to resume their ascent if Mr. Trump is able to provide fresh reasons for optimism about the prospects for tax cuts and fiscal stimulus. Should he disappoint investors, bond yields could fall, some say.\u201cThe market is looking to at least see a continued commitment with some optimistic tone in order to reallocate back into any reflation trades,\u201d said Michael Lorizio, senior trader at Manulife Asset Management. \u201cThe market wants specifics.\u201dOver the past month, lower Treasury yields have been rippling into other U.S. fixed-income markets, a sign of investors\u2019 robust appetite for income in a still-low-yield world.Junk bonds sold by lower-rated U.S. firms were the best fixed-income performers in February, with a total return of 1.35% in February though Monday, according to data from Bloomberg Barclays bond indexes.Over the same span, U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds returned 1%, municipal bonds returned 0.6%,\u00a0Treasury bonds returned 0.47% and Treasury inflation-protected securities returned 0.42%. Total return includes price gains and interest payments.U.S. stocks did even better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged a total return of nearly 5% in February through Monday, according to FactSet. The Dow closed Tuesday at 20812.24, declining 0.1% after 12 consecutive record closes.Ken Taubes, U.S. chief investment officer at Pioneer Investments, said the pattern of higher stocks and Treasury bond prices suggests that generous liquidity via bond buying from central banks in the eurozone and Japan continue to support a wide range of markets. Mr. Taubes said he doesn\u2019t expect U.S. stocks to suffer a big selloff unless the U.S. economy shows signs it is slipping into a recession or the Federal Reserve shocks investors with more aggressive interest-rate increases than many expect.The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen from 2.6% in mid-December, which was the highest since September 2014. The yield closed at a record low of 1.366% in early July.Some big money manages caution it is premature to say the tide is shifting back to lower yields.\u201cI don\u2019t see it as the beginning of a major reversal,\u201d said John Stopford, co-head of multiasset at Investec Asset Management.Mr. Stopford said he expects the 10-year yield may rise to 2.75% or higher over the next six months, driven by factors such as solid economic data, the prospect of fiscal stimulus and the Fed\u2019s plan to raise short-term interest rate this year.A number of Fed officials have signaled that a rate increase as soon as mid-March is on the table. Yields on short-term Treasurys that are highly sensitive to the Fed\u2019s outlook have risen this week as investors hedged against the risk of an imminent rate increase. Fed-funds futures, used by investors to bet on the Fed\u2019s policy outlook, showed late Tuesday 62% chances of a rate increase by the Fed\u2019s March 14-15 meeting, up sharply from 31% Monday, according to  CME Group Inc.Others point to factors that boost demand for Treasurys such as their more appealing yields compared with peers overseas and uncertainty surrounding the presidential race in France this spring.The yield on the 10-year German bund was 0.2% Tuesday, and the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond was 0.05%, according to Tradeweb.U.S. bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds targeting Treasury bonds attracted a net $183.9 million of funds for the week that ended Feb. 22, according to fund tracker Lipper. For the year, the sector has drawn in a net $865 million.Meanwhile, wagers on higher bond yields, or shorts, have declined lately, a sign some traders bought back bonds to trim bets.The share of investors expecting higher bond yields fell to 20% for the week that ended Monday from 25% a week ago, according to the weekly Treasury client survey from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The share of those who expect lower yields, reflecting higher prices, rose to 18% from 16%.The 10-year Treasury yield has been trading between 2.3% and 2.6% since mid-December. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index, which measures implied Treasury bond-price swings based on options, settled at 70.89 Monday, the highest in nearly a month.

This morning the government reported that GDP grew at the same sluggish 1.9% rate in the fourth quarter as previously estimated.

This raises the hope that at least we won\u2019t have to hear any more about the allegedly beautiful economy that President Obama has bequeathed to his successor. But it underlines the need for President Trump to show tonight that he\u2019s going to deliver on his promises of economic growth.Markets have been on a tear since Election Night, with the Dow up nearly 14% through Tuesday\u2019s close. This is based on Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to reduce the burden of taxes and rules imposed by Washington. For years prior to his election, markets were rising thanks in large part to historically low interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve. But investors and businesspeople didn\u2019t really believe Washington could manufacture prosperity. So big companies borrowed at low rates and then used the money to buy other companies or buy back their own stock or just sat on cash instead of investing in new equipment. This lack of investment meant we never got the productivity gains that make us all richer. Mr. Trump has made business operators more optimistic but it\u2019s not clear he\u2019s yet changed their behavior.When he addresses a Joint Session of Congress tonight, job creators need to see Mr. Trump\u2019s best-ever reality show\u2014a plan to move from the unreality of Washington economic management to a real market where stocks rise because of robust growth in sales and profits.Americans reasonably demand law and order, but this is not the night to focus on walls\u2014unless he\u2019s talking about tearing down the ones Washington has erected between Americans and their economic potential. The President thrilled the attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Now he needs a message devoted to economic growth. Dan Clifton of Strategas Research says, \u201cCPAC was playing to Trump\u2019s base and we expect tonight to be a different speech.\u201d As Mr. Clifton knows, social conservatives and reliable economic conservatives tend to be the same people, but the point is clear. Investors and business operators need to know they\u2019re going to get a tax cut this year and that Washington is going to take an occasional break from harassing them.This could arguably be the greatest Trump reality show ever. Unlike in season one of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d for example, when Mr. Trump faced a difficult choice between Bill and Kwame, Republicans in Congress are ready to advance both items on his growth agenda.

But the leaders of two conservative groups have said they can\u2019t support the health-insurance proposal.Rep. Mark Walker (R., N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, and Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, have objected to the proposal\u2019s tax credits, whose value would be pegged to a recipient\u2019s age, not income.To pay for the tax credits, House Republicans are considering capping how much of an employee\u2019s health benefits can be shielded from income and payroll taxes\u2014a broad move that would affect as many as 178 million Americans.\u201cIt says millionaires can get just as much of a tax credit and check from the federal government,\u201d Mr. Meadows said of the GOP leaders\u2019 proposal. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to pay for that by putting a tax on union workers and middle-class workers that happen to have good employer insurance\u2014that dog doesn\u2019t hunt.\u201dIn the Senate, where Republicans can lose no more than two votes to pass legislation without Democratic support, three conservative GOP senators said Monday night in a coordinated series of tweets that they would oppose any legislative effort that fell short of a full repeal of the 2010 health law.The current House GOP proposal would topple parts of the law\u2014some immediately, others after a transition period\u2014and seek to include some elements of a new, GOP-created health system. It would also allow some states to preserve their Medicaid population, if it had been expanded under the Affordable Care Act, for an undetermined period.\u201cCongress must keep its word. We were elected to fully repeal and replace Obamacare, and that\u2019s the only thing I will vote for,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) said in a statement.He was joined on Twitter by Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, who urged GOP leaders to bring to the floor legislation that Congress considered in 2015 and passed in early 2016 that would gut major chunks of the law, without including any elements of a plan to replace it. That legislation was vetoed by former President Barack Obama.Conservative groups, including the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks, are rallying behind the 2015 bill, because they know that it can meet the strict procedural requirements in the Senate that allow Republicans to pass health legislation with just a simple majority. Most bills need 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats.Many Republicans are also uncomfortable with components of Mr. Trump\u2019s first budget proposal, which administration officials outlined Monday. The president will call in Tuesday night\u2019s speech for proposing a $20 billion boost in current military spending and sharp cuts in other programs, without seeking the curbs on Medicare and Social Security that fiscal conservatives say are necessary.Some defense hawks, including the chairmen of the House and Senate Armed Services committees, said Mr. Trump\u2019s military budget falls short of what is needed to keep the armed forces ready and the country safe.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Tuesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed State Department budget was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d because its cuts would put \u201cdiplomats at risk.\u201dMeanwhile, many conservatives dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s reluctance to lower spending on the two big safety-net programs, Social Security and Medicare, saying they were optimistic he would change his mind as he spends more time grappling with the urgency of the federal budget deficit.\u201cIf he\u2019s here for eight years, he could potentially see Medicare go bankrupt while he\u2019s president,\u201d Mr. Meadows said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopefully going to give him a very persuasive argument on how he can save it.\u201dWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that the president was \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned about the potential revolt by conservatives, but she offered few kind words for the existing set of House leaders\u2019 proposals.\u201cA draft plan is exactly that, a draft. It\u2019s meant to open up the conversation,\u201d she said, adding that meetings the president had in recent days with governors and health insurance CEOs had all been intended \u201cto talk about how they can improve that plan.\u201d\u201cThis president is very clear he wants to work with Congress,\u201d she said.Mr. Trump and GOP leaders in Congress also have a challenge in satisfying centrist Republicans, who also have the power to derail the health bill. Those Republicans have said they won\u2019t vote to repeal the health law without providing nervous constituents a plan for its replacement.Many are also concerned about how states that expanded their Medicaid programs under the health law will fare when it is repealed.\u201cWe are a state that expanded Medicaid, so I have to have some assurances that some 20,000 that now have coverage, that we\u2019re not just dumping them,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) said recently.Mr. Trump met with governors and health-insurance CEOs Monday and vowed to replace the health law.\u201cNobody knew that health care could be so complicated,\u201d the president said, alluding to the challenge he will face in attempting to rally a fractured GOP.\u201cThere is a world of divide there,\u201d Rep. Mark Sanford (R., S.C.) said.\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com", "date": "2017-02-28T22:44:00.000Z", "title": "Trump needs to quash a conservative rebellion in Congress to see his legislation pass ", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582649864114325558"}, {"author": "Louise Radnofsky", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/president-trump-condemns-kansas-shooting-1488321774", "tags": ["kansas shooting"], "content": "The White House said President Donald Trump condemns \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d a Kansas triple shooting that left an Indian national dead and wounded two other men, saying that the attack appeared to be racially motivated and had no place in the U.S.\u201cAs more facts come to light and it begins to look like this was an act of racially motivated hatred, we want to reiterate that the president condemns these and any other racially or religiously motivated attacks in the strongest terms.

Trump and Putin.The conflicting statements come amid uncertain signals about a possible rapprochement between Moscow and Washington.Political analysts said the election of Mr. Trump had raised hopes in Moscow that the U.S. government would roll back a range of sanctions imposed after the Russian government annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and gave support to separatists in eastern Ukraine.Mr. Putin said in a congratulatory note he hoped Russia and the U.S. could work as equals following years of strained ties with President Barack Obama\u2019s White House. And Mr. Trump\u2014who has expressed open admiration for the Russian leader\u2014enjoyed positive coverage on Russian state-controlled television.But in recent days, Russian officials have tempered those expectations. Speaking in the resort city of Sochi on Tuesday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the country needed to be prepared for sanctions to continue, the news agency Interfax reported.\u201cWe must prepare for the fact that we will live under sanctions indefinitely,\u201d he said, according to Interfax.Pro-Kremlin commentators have also moderated their praise of Mr. Trump, as controversy simmers in Washington over Russia policy.House and Senate intelligence committees have begun probes of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, something the Kremlin has routinely denied.One hot-button issue includes contacts between Russian officials and former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, who resigned after acknowledging he mischaracterized his contacts with Moscow\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. The matter centers on a series of conversations between Mr. Flynn and Sergey Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., on the potential lifting of U.S. sanctions on Moscow over the alleged election interference.\u201cIn our contacts with the Americans, I once again say with all responsibility that we did not discuss and we are not discussing the criteria for lifting sanctions,\u201d Mr. Ryabkov said Tuesday.Under scrutiny also are contacts that involve alleged ties between other Trump associates and Moscow. The White House has disputed some of the accounts.Moscow also tried to spin the Flynn imbroglio. At the height of attention on Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversations with Russia\u2019s ambassador, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov muddied the waters by saying the two hadn\u2019t discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia.Shortly thereafter, Mr. Flynn resigned after reports on the transcripts of those conversations were leaked, contradicting his denials that sanctions were discussed.Mr. Putin previously had announced publicly that he was ready to meet Mr. Trump in a third country, Slovenia, the home country of First Lady Melania Trump. Mr. Trump didn\u2019t publicly respond to that suggestion.Possible opportunities are still on the horizon for the two leaders to meet. The Group of Seven leading industrialized nations is holding a summit in May, and a Group of 20 meeting of major world economies is planned in July.\u2014Carol E.

The change would relieve refiners of their obligation to buy renewable fuel blending credits.The price of those credits plunged and \u201ccame right out of the product margins\u201d when it appeared the program was poised to change, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. The prospect of a change set off a domino effect, pulling down gasoline prices and crude prices, analysts said.Brokers said the price declines reversed later in the day when the administration said it wasn\u2019t readying an order to restructure the program. Gasoline futures settled down 2.07 cents, or 1.35%, to $1.4949 a gallon. Diesel futures fell 1.91 cents, or 1.16%, to $1.6208 a gallon.\u2014Amy Harder and Jenny W.

Chief Executive Mary Barra said Tuesday that\u00a0tax proposals affecting imports could be \u201cproblematic\u201d for the auto maker.So far, there is little clarity on what Congress will do. House Republicans have proposed a so-called border adjustment\u2014taxing imports but not exports\u2014as part of a plan to cut the corporate tax rate. President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t backed or rejected that plan; he has talked about a \u201cbig border tax\u201d targeted at companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and then ship products back in. Either plan could be damaging to GM.Corporate executives across industries have been eyeing the tax debate nervously. Mr. Trump may discuss a tax overhaul later\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0during his first formal address to Congress.Tax proposals, \u201cif not done very thoughtfully, could be problematic,\u201d Ms. Barra said at the Economic Club of Washington. \u201cIt would take a period of time to make adjustments to that.\u201dMr. Trump discussed the tax plan with Ms. Barra and other executives earlier in February at a meeting of a business-advisory committee. \u201cWe had a very productive meeting,\u201d Ms. Barra said\u00a0Tuesday.\u201cWe support tax reform, but it\u2019s got to be done in a way that doesn\u2019t have unintended consequences,\u201d Ms. Barra said.GM and other global manufacturers based in the U.S. are paying careful attention as Mr. Trump and lawmakers discuss a variety of policies that could reshape their business models. Mr. Trump has warned about broad tariffs against Mexico and other trading partners, special taxes that would target companies moving production offshore and an overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta.Analysts say a border-adjusted tax could hurt GM more than other Detroit car makers because it brings in more products from\u00a0Mexico, including the import of\u00a0nearly\u00a0400,000\u00a0full-size pickups in 2016. The trucks account for the bulk of GM\u2019s global profits.  Ford Motor Co. imports small cars from Mexico but makes its lucrative F-series pickups in the U.S.GM also relies on parts made by its suppliers south of the border.

It was the largest and glitziest of the three Trump casinos, and the last to be closed, shut down last year amid labor tumult. Court papers say the signs were sold in a solid transaction and belong to the enterprising young people who spotted the opportunity while driving by the defunct casino in mid-February.Noticing the big \u201cTRUMP\u201d signs lying on the ground, they started chatting up the workers who had removed them from the casino, having recognized \u201cthe potential value in this iconic architectural artifact,\u201d court papers say.Not everyone felt the same about the Trump casino signs.According to the lawsuit filed in Common Pleas Court in Philadelphia, one of the workers mentioned during haggling over the signs that on a previous trip to dispose a large \u201cTRUMP\u201d sign, he was greeted \u201cthroughout his travels in the Atlantic City area by rude gestures and insults.\u201d Eastern Sign Tech LLC, the company performing the removal, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Tuesday.\u201cAtlantic City people were giving them the finger and yelling obscenities,\u201d Zachary Grayson, lawyer for the sign buyers, said in an interview Tuesday, reporting what the workers told his clients.\u201cAs you can imagine, the president is not a popular man in Atlantic City.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s involvement in the Atlantic City gambling industry involved multiple bankruptcies, dozens of unpaid suppliers and contractors, thousands of lost jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars in bond defaults and, ultimately, ruin for all three casinos that bore his name.The Trump brand, now burnished by Mr. Trump\u2019s status as president of the U.S., survived.The price agreed for the two Taj Mahal Trump signs was $250. It was \u201cpure Art of the Deal,\u201d Mr. Grayson said, referring to a book that carries Mr. Trump\u2019s name as author.The buyers took possession and formed a partnership to handle their prize. They called the venture Recycling of Urban Materials for Profit, or RUMP in short.RUMP\u2019s right to cash in on the discarded \u201cTRUMP\u201d signs was challenged when Eastern Sign stepped in, stopping a lively  eBay auction in which bidding for one sign had reached $7,500. According to the lawsuit, Eastern Sign said the original sale of the discarded signs was unauthorized.RUMP sued Eastern Sign and Trump Taj Mahal Associates LLC, claiming rights to both \u201cTRUMP\u201d signs. Trump Taj Mahal is now controlled by former Trump rival and current adviser Carl Icahn . The suit says Mr. Icahn\u2019s company surrendered claims to the signs by discarding them. Mr. Icahn didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization didn\u2019t immediately comment.RUMP is seeking damages of $100,000 or a judgment declaring it the rightful owner of the signs. It noted that a Coca-Cola sign sold for more than that amount, and the Coke sign didn\u2019t have the added value of the White House association.This isn\u2019t the first lawsuit over the Trump name on the Atlantic City casinos. In 2014, Mr. Trump and his daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump sued to have the Trump name removed from the casinos, saying the gambling halls and hotels were so poorly maintained they were a threat to a valuable brand.The lawsuit was settled during the bankruptcy that followed, which saw the last of the Trump casinos shut down.Write to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com", "date": "2017-02-28T21:43:00.000Z", "title": "Trump name spells lawsuit over discarded casino signs ", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582650040471763890"}, {"author": "Aaron Kuriloff and Riva Gold", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stocks-rise-ahead-of-trumps-speech-to-congress-1488250815", "tags": ["asian equities", "asian shares", "asian stock markets", "asia shares", "equity markets", "europe markets", "forex", "futures", "nikkei 225", "oil markets", "stock markets", "stoxx", "Cobham", "COB.LN", "UK:COB", "Meggitt", "MGGT.LN", "Tokyo Keiki", "7721.TO", "Boeing", "BA", "Wal-Mart Stores", "WMT", "Target", "TGT", "Ishikawa Seisakusho", "6208.TO", "Donald Trump", "Mehren%2C%20Allan%20von", "Yoon%2C%20Jae", "plans", "strategy", "financial performance", "earnings projections", "corporate", "industrial news", "political", "general news", "politics", "international relations", "domestic politics", "elections", "national", "presidential elections", "debt", "bond markets", "money", "forex markets", "foreign exchange news", "commodity markets", "energy markets", "commodity", "financial market news", "crude oil", "natural gas product markets", "government debt", "national government debt", "routine market", "financial news", "stock market commentary", "machinery", "textile machinery manufacturing", "aerospace products", "parts", "aircraft cabin equipment", "civil aircraft", "measuring", "precision instruments", "retail", "wholesale", "mixed retailing", "department stores", "shopping malls", "superstores", "aerospace", "defense", "industrial electronics", "industrial goods", "technology"], "content": "The S&P 500 slipped Tuesday but notched its best month since March with a 3.7% gain.Investors have been piling into stocks in anticipation of Trump-administration tax cuts, increased infrastructure spending and other policies that could boost corporate earnings.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.8% in February, its biggest monthly climb since November.Declines have been rare and relatively minor.The blue-chip index fell 25.20 points, or 0.1%, to 20812.24 Tuesday after reaching a 12th-consecutive record a day earlier.The S&P 500 lost 6.11 points, or 0.3%, Tuesday to 2363.64\u2014for its biggest daily decline of the month.Major U.S. stock indexes have risen for four consecutive months.

For example, the decline of the British pound may make London office property look cheap to foreign investors, they say.Many MIPIM participants are citing the U.K. vote last year to leave the European Union as a textbook case of how to make fast profits from political change.Immediately after the June vote\u2019s surprise results, commercial real-estate values fell and some funds were forced to sell properties to return money to anxious investors. But values of many properties bounced back quickly, enriching gutsy investors who purchased when values fell.\u201cLondon actually became, on a relative basis, more attractive than it was before,\u201d said Martin Samworth, head of Europe for  CBRE Group Inc.Real-estate developers, brokers and others in the industry have a reputation for bullishness. Past conferences have been known for optimistic tones\u2014even in 2009, when attendance was down 40% from its peak year in 2008 due to the global financial crisis.This year, some of the bulls acknowledge certain political scenarios being discussed aren\u2019t pretty, like France\u2019s possible departure from the Euro Zone. Financial dangers hanging over the global real-estate industry\u2014like a possible spike in interest rates\u2014could do greater damage than political events, experts say.Still, many MIPIM participants say there are plenty of ways to take advantage of volatility, especially for investors willing to assume big risk. \u201cIf you\u2019re an opportunist investor you should be all over the market, watching for these things to happen,\u201d said Rasheed Hassan, Savills\u2019s head of cross-border investing.MIPIM organizers expect hundreds of cities and about 90 countries to be represented at the conference, including, for the first time, Armenia, Paraguay and Uzbekistan. Representatives of these government bodies, like the private-equity firms, sovereign-wealth funds, brokers, developers and other attendees, can also be expected to put the best spin possible on political changes.For example, Sir Howard Bernstein, chief executive of the Manchester City Council, said in a pre-MIPIM interview some of the concerns about the Brexit vote could be overblown.\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving Europe. That\u2019s point number one,\u201d he said. \u201cPoint number two is, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real clarity about the basis upon which we\u2019ll be exiting from the European Union.\u201dMontenegro representatives say they plan to put a positive spin at MIPIM on their country\u2019s efforts to join the NATO alliance, although others say uncertainties about relations between Russia and the new Trump administration could add obstacles to that effort.\u201cWe expect to soon formalize the membership,\u201d said Pavle Radulovic, Montenegro\u2019s minister of sustainable development and tourism, in an email.Mr. Radulovic also predicted that NATO membership for Montenegro would lead to further foreign investment in the country\u2019s real estate.\u201cWe expect economic benefit from the [NATO] membership since states that are part of the alliance are perceived as stable and safe for their investments and businesses,\u201d he said.Write to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com", "date": "2017-02-28T19:52:00.000Z", "title": "A global real estate conference in an era of anti-globalism ", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582649882258559786"}, {"author": "Heather Gillers", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/prison-bonds-are-going-through-the-roof-thanks-to-trumps-immigration-policy-1488287049", "tags": ["defaulted prisons", "donald trump prisons", "immigration", "immigration reform", "prison bonds", "prison stocks", "private prisons", "texas prisons", "willacy county", "Phorcys Capital Partners", "Management & Training", "Kelly%2C%20John", "Barasch%2C%20Jon", "Sfyris%2C%20Vasileios", "capacity", "facilities", "corporate", "industrial news", "facility closures", "political", "general news", "national", "public security", "crime", "legal action", "international relations", "law enforcement", "migration", "politics", "prisons", "prisoners"], "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is making the bonds of some deserted prisons valuable again.Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last week directed federal immigration and customs officials to \u201ctake all necessary action and allocate all available resources to expand their detention capabilities and capacities at or near the border with Mexico.\u201dThe directive could be a boon to investors in mothballed prison facilities in Texas and Arizona: In its aftermath, their thinly traded, deeply depressed bonds have soared. Holders of defaulted prison debt have a much better shot at repayment now that President Trump\u2019s tough stance on illegal immigration appears to have intensified interest among potential purchasers of the facilities.An investor who paid $7,650 for $100,000 of Willacy County, Texas, prison bonds that changed hands at a deep discount in December could make an almost $60,000 profit by selling them now, based on trades tracked Friday by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.\u201cThe prison junk-bond sector of the municipal market was more or less left for dead and now appears to have new life,\u201d said Jon Barasch, a director at ICE Data Services.There is about $1.1 billion in outstanding high-yield jail- or prison-bond debt, sold by 28 municipal issuers, according to the firm. The bonds represent a tiny corner of the $3.8 trillion municipal market.Three Texas facilities in Jones, Maverick and Willacy counties that have attracted interest from prospective buyers and operators together represent about $140 million in outstanding bonds. Some trade only a few times a year.Bonds issued to build the Jones County prison jumped to nearly 60 cents on the dollar last week from about 12 cents in December, according to MSRB data. Bonds issued to refinance the Willacy County prison jumped to more than 65 cents on the dollar from less than eight cents at the end of last year. Prices on the Maverick prison bonds remain largely unchanged.A trustee for bondholders in a prison in Jones County that defaulted on its bonds in 2011 said in February that it had received an offer to buy the facility for $30 million. On Friday, a private company that until 2015 ran an immigrant detention center in a local prison in Willacy County confirmed that it is working with the county to try to use the facility for that purpose again.\u00a0And a trustee for bondholders in the Maverick County detention center, which defaulted in 2014, disclosed Thursday that it is working to close a takeover offer from an operator of immigrant detention facilities.The new policies have created large gains for bondholders like Phorcys Capital Partners LLC, a hedge fund based in Alpharetta, Ga., that last year bought Willacy prison bonds for less than 10 cents on the dollar, according to fund manager Vasileios Sfyris. Mr. Sfyris said he expected the prison would be sold off and bondholders would recover about 25 cents on the dollar.Mr. Sfyris didn\u2019t realize they could be worth much more until President Trump started shifting national immigration policy, boosting the value of the prisons, he said. \u201cAll of a sudden I\u2019m seeing all these notices that Willacy is getting offers well above market expectations,\u201d he said.Debt connected to two other defaulted prisons in Texas and Arizona also traded higher Friday. Some bonds issued to open a Dickens County, Texas, detention center traded at nine cents on the dollar after trading at between one and two cents for much of last year. Bonds to refinance a detention center near Yuma, Ariz., jumped to nearly 60 cents after trading at 40 cents on the dollar in December.The bond rally is only the latest good news for prison investors. On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked an Obama administration directive to phase out contracts with for-profit prison operators. Stocks in private prison companies extended a rally that began with Mr. Trump\u2019s November election.Since election day, shares in  CoreCivic Inc. have climbed 140% and those in  GEO Group Inc. have doubled. \u201cThere\u2019s material opportunity for private prisons to expand their capacity,\u201d said analyst Michael Kodesch of Canaccord Genuity.That expansion could benefit municipal issuers struggling to pay back construction costs for empty prisons. As in the case of Willacy, the federal Bureau of Prisons sometimes contracts to use those facilities as privately operated immigrant detention centers.Just six months ago, S&P Global Ratings predicted near-certain default for the Willacy prison, after a 2015 prisoner revolt seriously damaged the facility, prompting federal officials to cancel the contract and relocate the inmates.The Jones County prison defaulted in 2011 after the state of Texas in 2010 canceled a plan to house inmates there, according to documents filed with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.Prison operator Management & Training Corp., the private company that ran the Willacy facility until 2015, said unused local prisons are often among the options it considers for operation as immigrant detention centers. About 65% of immigrants detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency are housed in facilities operated by private, for-profit contractors, according to a December report by the Homeland Security Advisory Council.A takeover of a defaulted prison could allow the trustee to cancel the bonds and at least partially reimburse bondholders. The offer disclosed by Maverick County detention center will pave the way for the trustee to distribute more than $19 million to bondholders, the disclosure said.Even before Mr. Trump took office the U.S. was short on space to hold detainees. Authorities have been struggling to find free beds since October, when the number of people detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency hit 40,000.S&P Global Ratings Managing Director Horacio Aldrete said both jail operations contracts and presidential administrations are far shorter than the multidecade life of a municipal bond. The sector \u201cwill continue to be vulnerable,\u201d Mr.\u00a0Aldrete said.\u2014Matt Wirz and Beth Reinhard  contributed to this article.Write to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com", "date": "2017-02-28T19:39:00.000Z", "title": "Prison bonds are going through the roof thanks to Trump\u2019s immigration policy ", "id": "SB11849978673534134861004582648132124335316"}]
